misspelled word dialog
( if you do not have ispell installed you can obtain it from the international ispell home page . aspell is available from the aspell home page . ) 
general use
the top line in the dialog displays a possibly misspelled word which was found in your document . & sonnet ; attempts to find an appropriate replacement word . one or several may be found . the best guess is shown to the right of replacement : . to accept this replacement , click on replace . you may also select a word from the list of suggestions and then click replace to replace the misspelled word with the selected word . 
to keep your original spelling , click on ignore . 
to stop the spellchecking - - keeping the changes you ' ve already made - - click on stop . 
to stop the spellchecking and cancel the changes you ' ve already made , click on cancel . 
clicking on replace all will initially perform the same function as clicking on replace , but will automatically replace the misspelled word with the chosen replacement word , if it appears again ( at a later point ) in your document . 
the ignore all button ignores this and all future occurrences of the misspelled word . 
clicking on add will add the misspelled word to your personal dictionary ( this is distinct from the original system dictionary , so the additions you make will not be seen by other users ) . 
configuration dialog
dictionaries
you can choose the dictionary to use for spellchecking from the list of installed dictionaries . 
encodings
the most commonly used character encodings are : 
us - ascii
this is the character set used for english text . 
iso - 8859 - 1
this is used for western european languages . 
utf - 8
this is a unicode encoding that can be used for almost any language , if your system has the necessary fonts . 
you should select the one that matches the character set you are using . in some cases , dictionaries will support more than one encoding . a dictionary might , for example , accept accented characters when iso - 8859 - 1 is selected , but accept email - style character combinations ( like ' a for an accented a ) when us - ascii is selected . please see your dictionary ' s distribution for more information .

it is recommend that you do not change the first two options unless you have read the international ispell man page .

file pattern ( s ) : 
pattern ( s ) of files to be analyzed . wildcards : ' * ' and ' ? ' several patterns can be specified by using the separator : ' ; ' 
file - anti - pattern ( s ) : 
pattern ( s ) of files to be excluded from analysis . wildcards : ' * ' and ' ? ' several patterns can be specified by using the separator : ' ; ' 
dir - anti - pattern ( s ) : 
pattern ( s ) of directories to be excluded from analysis . wildcards : ' * ' and ' ? ' several patterns can be specified by using the separator : ' ; ' 
use . cvsignore
extends the antipattern to anything that would be ignored by cvs . via local " . cvsignore " files this can be directory specific . 
find hidden files and directories
finds files and directories with the hidden attribute . 
finds files and directories starting with ' . ' . 
follow file links
on : compare the file the link points to . off : compare the links . 
follow directory links
on : compare the directory the link points to . off : compare the links . 
file comparison mode
binary comparison
binary comparison of each file . ( default ) 
full analysis
do a full analysis and show statistics information in extra columns . ( slower than a binary comparison , much slower for binary files . ) 
trust the size and modification date ( unsafe ) 
assume that files are equal if the modification date and file length are equal . files with equal contents but different modification dates will appear as different . useful for big directories or slow networks . 
trust the size and date , but use binary comparison if date does not match ( unsafe ) 
assume that files are equal if the modification date and file length are equal . if the dates are not equal but the sizes are , use binary comparison . useful for big directories or slow networks . 
trust the size ( unsafe ) 
assume that files are equal if their file lengths are equal . useful for big directories or slow networks when the date is modified during download . 
synchronize directories
offers to store files in both directories so that both directories are the same afterwards . works only when comparing two directories without specifying a destination . 
white space differences considered equal
copy newer instead of merging ( unsafe ) 
do n ' t look inside , just take the newer file . ( use this only if you know what you are doing ! ) only effective when comparing two directories . 
backup files ( . orig ) 
if a file would be saved over an old file , then the old file will be renamed with a ' . orig ' extension instead of being deleted .

mount root filesystem & read - only
mount the root filesystem for this kernel read - only . since the init scripts normally take care of remounting the root filesystem in read - write mode after running some checks , this should always be turned on . do not turn this off unless you know what you are doing . 
do not check & partition table
this turns off some sanity checks while writing the configuration . this should not be used under " normal " circumstances , but it can be useful , for example , by providing the capability of booting from a floppy disk , without having a floppy in the drive every time you run lilo . this sets the unsafe keyword in lilo . conf . 
& record boot command lines for defaults
checking this box enables automatic recording of boot command lines as the default for the following bootups . this way , lilo " locks " on a choice until it is manually overridden . this sets the lock option in lilo . conf
restrict parameters
if this box is checked , a password ( entered below ) is required only if any parameters are changed ( i . e . the user can boot linux , but not linux single or linux init = / bin / sh ) . this sets the restricted option in lilo . conf . 
require & password : 
enter the password required for bootup ( if any ) here . if restricted above is checked , the password is required for additional parameters only . warning : the password is stored in clear text in / etc / lilo . conf . make sure that nobody untrusted can read this file . also , you probably do not want to use your normal / root password here .

you can edit the lilo . conf file directly here . all changes you make here are automatically transferred to the graphical interface . 
install & boot record to drive / partition : 
select the drive or partition you want to install the lilo boot loader to here . unless you intend to use other boot managers in addition to lilo , this should be the mbr ( master boot record ) of your boot drive . in this case , you should probably select / dev / hda if your boot drive is an ide drive or / dev / sda if your boot drive is scsi . 
boot the default kernel / os & after : 
/ 10 seconds
lilo will wait the amount of time specified here before booting the kernel ( or os ) marked as default in the images tab . 
use & linear mode
check this box if you want to use the linear mode . linear mode tells the boot loader the location of kernels in linear addressing rather than sector / head / cylinder . linear mode is required for some scsi drives , and should not cause problems unless you are planning to create a boot disk to be used with a different computer . see the lilo . conf man page for details . 
use & compact mode
checking this box enables automatic recording of boot command lines as the defaults for the following boots . this way , lilo " locks " on a choice until it is manually overridden . this sets the lock option in lilo . conf . 
if this box is checked , a password ( entered below ) is required only if any parameters are changed ( i . e . the user can boot linux , but not linux single or linux init = / bin / sh ) . this sets the restricted option in lilo . conf . this sets a default for all linux kernels you want to boot . if you need a per - kernel setting , go to the operating systems tab and select details . 
enter the password required for bootup ( if any ) here . if restricted is checked above , the password is only required for additional parameters . warning : the password is stored in clear text in / etc / lilo . conf . make sure that nobody untrusted can read this file . also , you probably do not want to use your normal / root password here . this sets a default for all linux kernels you want to boot . if you need a per - kernel setting , go to the operating systems tab and select details . 
& default graphics mode on text console : 
you can select the default graphics mode here . if you intend to use a vga graphics mode , you must compile the kernel with support for framebuffer devices . the ask setting brings up a prompt at boot time . this sets a default for all linux kernels you want to boot . if you need a per - kernel setting , go to the operating systems tab and select details . 
enter lilo & prompt automatically
if this box is checked , lilo goes to the lilo prompt whether or not a key is pressed . if it is turned off , lilo boots the default operating system unless shift is pressed ( in that case , it goes to the lilo prompt ) . this sets the prompt option in lilo . conf . 
this is the list of kernels and operating systems you can currently boot . select which one you want to edit here . 
& kernel : 
enter the filename of the kernel you want to boot here . 
& label : 
enter the label ( name ) of the kernel you want to boot here . 
& root filesystem : 
enter the root filesystem ( i . e . the partition that will be mounted as / at boot time ) for the kernel you want to boot here . 
& initial ramdisk : 
if you want to use an initial ramdisk ( initrd ) for this kernel , enter its filename here . leave this field blank if you do not intend to use an initial ramdisk for this kernel . 
extra parameters : 
enter any extra parameters you wish to pass to the kernel here . usually , this can be left blank . this sets the append option in lilo . conf . 
set & default
boot this kernel / os if the user does not make a different choice
this button brings up a dialog box with further , less commonly used , options . 
& probe
automatically generate a ( hopefully ) reasonable lilo . conf for your system
& check configuration
run lilo in test mode to see if the configuration is okay . 
add & kernel . . . 
add a new linux kernel to the boot menu
add other & os . . . 
add a non - linux os to the boot menu
remove entry from the boot menu
configuration okay . lilo reported : 
configuration okay
configuration not okay . lilo reported : 
configuration not okay
& kernel filename : 
boot from disk : 
enter here the partition containing the operating system you would like to boot . 
disk : 
& general options
& operating systems
& expert
this turns off some sanity checks while writing the configuration . this should not be used under " normal " circumstances , but it is useful , for example , for installing the possibility to boot from a floppy disk without having a floppy in the drive every time you run lilo . this sets the unsafe keyword in lilo . conf . 
& what ' s this ? 
the what ' s this ? button is part of this program ' s help system . click on the what ' s this button , then on any widget in the window to get information ( like this ) on it . 
this button calls up the program ' s online help system . if it does nothing , no help file has been written ( yet ) ; in that case , use the what ' s this button on the left . 
& default
this button resets all parameters to some ( hopefully sane ) default values . 
this button resets all parameters to what they were before you started the program . 
this button saves all your changes without exiting . 
this button saves all your changes and exits the program .

kdat will dump your files properly to tape , but may not be able to restore them . to restore your files by hand , you need to know the name of the * non - rewinding * version of your tape device % 1 . 
for example , if your device is / dev / st0 , the non - rewinding version is / dev / nst0 . if your device name does not look like that , type " ls - l % 1 " in a terminal window to see the real name of your tape drive . substitute that name for / dev / nst0 below . open a terminal window and type the following : tar tfv / dev / nst0 ; tar tfv / dev / nst0 tar xfv / dev / nst0 the third call to " tar " will retrieve your data into your current directory . please let us know if this happens to you . - kdat maintenance team

the source of the user and group database
this option allows you to select where the user / group data stored . currently three storage backends are supported . files stores user / group data in traditional / etc / passwd and / etc / group flat files . ldap stores data in a directory server using the posixaccount and posixgroup object classes ; this backend allows the management of samba users / groups via the sambasamaccount object class . system provides a read - only access to all users and groups which your installation knows about . 
shell
this option allows you to select the shell which will be the default for new users . 
home path template
this option specifies the unix home path template for new users . the ' % u ' macro will replaced with the actual user name . 
first uid
this options specifies the first user id where searching for an available uid starts . 
first gid
this options specifies the first group id where searching for an available gid starts . 
if this option is checked then a home directory will created for the new user . 
if this option is checked then the contents of the skeleton folder will copied to the new user ' s home directory
if this option is enabled , new user creation will create a private group named as the user , and the primary group of the user will assigned to this private group . 
default primary group
this is the default primary group which will be assigned to a newly created user .

after pressing ctrl + alt + i , the ksirc window will be activated , if it exists . simple . 
activate ksirc window
ksirc window
ksirc
after pressing alt + ctrl + h the input of ' hello ' will be simulated , as if you typed it . this is especially useful if you have call to frequently type a word ( for instance , ' unsigned ' ) . every keypress in the input is separated by a colon ' : ' . note that the keypresses literally mean keypresses , so you have to write what you would press on the keyboard . in the table below , the left column shows the input and the right column shows what to type . \\ " enter " ( i . e . new line ) enter or return\ a ( i . e . small a ) a\ a ( i . e . capital a ) shift + a\ : ( colon ) shift + ; \ ' ' ( space ) space
type ' hello ' 
this action runs konsole , after pressing ctrl + alt + t . 
run konsole
read the comment on the " type ' hello ' " action first . \\ qt designer uses ctrl + f4 for closing windows . in kde , however , ctrl + f4 is the shortcut for going to virtual desktop 4 , so this shortcut does not work in qt designer . further , qt designer does not use kde ' s standard ctrl + w for closing the window . \\ this problem can be solved by remapping ctrl + w to ctrl + f4 when the active window is qt designer . when qt designer is active , every time ctrl + w is pressed , ctrl + f4 will be sent to qt designer instead . in other applications , the effect of ctrl + w is unchanged . \\ we now need to specify three things : a new shortcut trigger on ' ctrl + w ' , a new keyboard input action sending ctrl + f4 , and a new condition that the active window is qt designer . \ qt designer seems to always have title ' qt designer by trolltech ' , so the condition will check for the active window having that title . 
remap ctrl + w to ctrl + f4 in qt designer
by pressing alt + ctrl + w a d - bus call will be performed that will show the minicli . you can use any kind of d - bus call , just like using the command line ' qdbus ' tool . 
perform d - bus call ' kdesktop kdesktopiface popupexecutecommand ( ) ' 
read the comment on the " type ' hello ' " action first . \\ just like the " type ' hello ' " action , this one simulates keyboard input , specifically , after pressing ctrl + alt + b , it sends b to xmms ( b in xmms jumps to the next song ) . the ' send to specific window ' checkbox is checked and a window with its class containing ' xmms _ player ' is specified ; this will make the input always be sent to this window . this way , you can control xmms even if , for instance , it is on a different virtual desktop . \\ ( run ' xprop ' and click on the xmms window and search for wm _ class to see ' xmms _ player ' ) . 
next in xmms

konqueror in kde3.1 has tabs , and now you can also have gestures . \\ just press the middle mouse button and start drawing one of the gestures , and after you are finished , release the mouse button . if you only need to paste the selection , it still works , just click the middle mouse button . ( you can change the mouse button to use in the global settings ) . \\ right now , there are the following gestures available : \ move right and back left - forward ( alt + right ) \ move left and back right - back ( alt + left ) \ move up and back down - up ( alt + up ) \ circle anticlockwise - reload ( f5 ) \\ the gesture shapes can be entered by performing them in the configuration dialog . you can also look at your numeric pad to help you : gestures are recognized like a 3x3 grid of fields , numbered 1 to 9 . \\ note that you must perform exactly the gesture to trigger the action . because of this , it is possible to enter more gestures for the action . you should try to avoid complicated gestures where you change the direction of mouse movement more than once . for instance , 45654 or 74123 are simple to perform , but 1236987 may be already quite difficult . \\ the conditions for all gestures are defined in this group . all these gestures are active only if the active window is konqueror ( class contains ' konqueror ' ) .

about bug reporting - help
information about bug reporting
you can help us improve this software by filing a bug report . 
it is safe to close this dialog . if you do not want to , you do not have to file a bug report . 
in order to generate a useful bug report we need some information about both the crash and your system . ( you may also need to install some debug packages . ) 
bug reporting assistant guide
this assistant will guide you through the crash reporting process for the kde bug reports database site . all the information you enter on the bug report must be in english , if possible , as kde is formed internationally . 
what do you know about the crash ? 
in this page you need to describe how much do you know about the desktop and the application state before it crashed . 
if you can , describe in as much detail as possible the crash circumstances , and what you were doing when the application crashed ( this information is going to be requested later . ) you can mention : 
actions you were taking inside or outside the application
documents or images that you were using and their type / format ( later if you go to look at the report in the bug tracking system , you can attach a file to the report ) 
widgets that you were running
the url of a web site you were browsing
configuration details of the application
or other strange things you notice before or after the crash . 
screenshots can be very helpful sometimes . you can attach them to the bug report after it is posted to the bug tracking system . 
crash information ( backtrace ) 
this page will generate a " backtrace " of the crash . this is information that tells the developers where the application crashed . 
if the crash information is not detailed enough , you may need to install some debug packages and reload it ( if the install debug symbols button is available you can use it to automatically install the missing information . ) 
you can find more information about backtraces , what they mean , and how they are useful at % 1
once you get a useful backtrace ( or if you do not want to install the missing debugging packages ) you can continue . 
conclusions
using the quality of the crash information gathered , and your answers on the previous page , the assistant will tell you if the crash is worth reporting or not . 
if the crash is worth reporting but the application is not supported in the kde bug tracking system , you will need to directly contact the maintainer of the application . 
login into the bug tracking system
we may need to contact you in the future to ask for further information . as we need to keep track of the bug reports , you need to have an account on the kde bug tracking system . if you do not have one , you can create one here : % 1
then , enter your username and password and press the login button . you can use this login to directly access the kde bug tracking system later . 
the kwallet dialog may appear when pressing login to save your password in the kwallet password system . also , it will prompt you for the kwallet password upon loading to autocomplete the login fields if you use this assistant again . 
list of possible duplicate reports
this page will search the bug report database for similar crashes which are possible duplicates of your bug . if there are similar bug reports found , you can double click on them to see details . then , read the current bug report information so you can check to see if they are similar . 
if you are very sure your bug is the same as another that is previously reported , you can set your information to be attached to the existing report . 
if you are unsure whether your report is the same , follow the main options to tentatively mark your crash as a duplicate of that report . this is usually the safest thing to do . we cannot uncombine bug reports , but we can easily merge them . 
if not enough possible duplicates are found , or you did not find a similar report , then you can force it to search for more bug reports ( only if the date range limit is not reached . ) 
if you do not find any related reports , your crash information is not useful enough , and you really cannot give additional information about the crash context , then it is better to not file the bug report , thereby closing the assistant . 
details of the bug report and your system
in this case you need to write a title and description of the crash . explain as best you can . 
you can also specify your distribution method ( gnu / linux distribution or packaging system ) or if you compiled the kde platform from sources . 
you should write in english . 
sending the crash report
the last page will send the bug report to the bug tracking system and will notify you when it is done . it will then show the web address of the bug report in the kde bug tracking system , so that you can look at the report later . 
if the process fails , you can click retry to try sending the bug report again . if the report cannot be sent because the bug tracking database has a problem , you can save it to a file to manually report later . 
thank you for being part of kde !

this backtrace appears to be of no use . this is probably because your packages are built in a way which prevents creation of proper backtraces , or the stack frame was seriously corrupted in the crash . 
loading backtrace . . . 
the following options are enabled : 
as the usage of these options is not recommended - because they can , in rare cases , be responsible for kde problems - a backtrace will not be generated . you need to turn these options off and reproduce the problem again in order to get a backtrace .

do you want to generate a backtrace ? this will help the developers to figure out what went wrong . unfortunately this will take some time on slow machines . note : a backtrace is not a substitute for a proper description of the bug and information on how to reproduce it . it is not possible to fix the bug without a proper description .

show file in embedded viewer
show file in separate viewer
here you can configure what the konqueror file manager will do when you click on a file belonging to this group . konqueror can display the file in an embedded viewer or start up a separate application . you can change this setting for a specific file type in the ' embedding ' tab of the file type configuration . dolphin shows files always in a separate viewer
this button displays the icon associated with the selected file type . click on it to choose a different icon . 
this is the icon associated with the selected file type . choosing a different icon requires shared - mime - info to be at least version 0.40 . 
filename patterns
this box contains a list of patterns that can be used to identify files of the selected type . for example , the pattern * . txt is associated with the file type ' text / plain ' ; all files ending in ' . txt ' are recognized as plain text files . 
add a new pattern for the selected file type . 
remove the selected filename pattern . 
you can enter a short description for files of the selected file type ( e . g . ' html page ' ) . this description will be used by applications like konqueror to display directory content . 
ask whether to save to disk instead ( only for konqueror browser ) 
here you can configure what the konqueror file manager will do when you click on a file of this type . konqueror can either display the file in an embedded viewer , or start up a separate application . if set to ' use settings for g group ' , the file manager will behave according to the settings of the group g to which this type belongs ; for instance , ' image ' if the current file type is image / png . dolphin always shows files in a separate viewer .

file associations this module allows you to choose which applications are associated with a given type of file . file types are also referred to as mime types ( mime is an acronym which stands for " multipurpose internet mail extensions " ) . a file association consists of the following : rules for determining the mime - type of a file , for example the filename pattern * . png , which means ' all files with names that end in . png ' , is associated with the mime type " image / png " ; a short description of the mime - type , for example the description of the mime type " image / png " is simply ' png image ' ; an icon to be used for displaying files of the given mime - type , so that you can easily identify the type of file in a file manager or file - selection dialog ( at least for the types you use often ) ; a list of the applications which can be used to open files of the given mime - type - - if more than one application can be used then the list is ordered by priority . you may be surprised to find that some mime types have no associated filename patterns ; in these cases , kde is able to determine the mime - type by directly examining the contents of the file . 
find file type or filename pattern
enter a part of a filename pattern , and only file types with a matching file pattern will appear in the list . alternatively , enter a part of a file type name as it appears in the list . 
known types
here you can see a hierarchical list of the file types which are known on your system . click on the ' + ' sign to expand a category , or the ' - ' sign to collapse it . select a file type ( e . g . text / html for html files ) to view / edit the information for that file type using the controls on the right .

colors this module allows you to choose the color scheme used for the kde desktop . the different elements of the desktop , such as title bars , menu text , etc . , are called " widgets " . you can choose the widget whose color you want to change by selecting it from a list , or by clicking on a graphical representation of the desktop . you can save color settings as complete color schemes , which can also be modified or deleted . kde comes with several predefined color schemes on which you can base your own . all kde applications will obey the selected color scheme . non - kde applications may also obey some or all of the color settings , if this option is enabled . 
this is a preview of the color settings which will be applied if you click " apply " or " ok " . you can click on different parts of this preview image . the widget name in the " widget color " box will change to reflect the part of the preview image you clicked . 
this is a list of predefined color schemes , including any that you may have created . you can preview an existing color scheme by selecting it from the list . the current scheme will be replaced by the selected color scheme . warning : if you have not yet applied any changes you may have made to the current scheme , those changes will be lost if you select another color scheme . 
press this button if you want to save the current color settings as a color scheme . you will be prompted for a name . 
press this button to remove the selected color scheme . note that this button is disabled if you do not have permission to delete the color scheme .

physical memory
this graph gives you an overview of the usage of physical memory in your system . most operating systems ( including linux ) will use as much of the available physical memory as possible as disk cache , to speed up the system performance . this means that if you have a small amount of free physical memory and a large amount of disk cache memory , your system is well configured . 
swap space
the swap space is the virtual memory available to the system . it will be used on demand and is provided through one or more swap partitions and / or swap files .

mouse this module allows you to choose various options for the way in which your pointing device works . your pointing device may be a mouse , trackball , or some other hardware that performs a similar function . 
if you are left - handed , you may prefer to swap the functions of the left and right buttons on your pointing device by choosing the ' left - handed ' option . if your pointing device has more than two buttons , only those that function as the left and right buttons are affected . for example , if you have a three - button mouse , the middle button is unaffected . 
the default behavior in kde is to select and activate icons with a single click of the left button on your pointing device . this behavior is consistent with what you would expect when you click links in most web browsers . if you would prefer to select with a single click , and activate with a double click , check this option . 
activates and opens a file or folder with a single click . 
if you check this option , pausing the mouse pointer over an icon on the screen will automatically select that icon . this may be useful when single clicks activate icons , and you want only to select the icon without activating it . 
if you have checked the option to automatically select icons , this slider allows you to select how long the mouse pointer must be paused over the icon before it is selected . 
& cursor theme
pointer acceleration : 
this option allows you to change the relationship between the distance that the mouse pointer moves on the screen and the relative movement of the physical device itself ( which may be a mouse , trackball , or some other pointing device . ) a high value for the acceleration will lead to large movements of the mouse pointer on the screen even when you only make a small movement with the physical device . selecting very high values may result in the mouse pointer flying across the screen , making it hard to control . 
pointer threshold : 
the threshold is the smallest distance that the mouse pointer must move on the screen before acceleration has any effect . if the movement is smaller than the threshold , the mouse pointer moves as if the acceleration was set to 1x ; thus , when you make small movements with the physical device , there is no acceleration at all , giving you a greater degree of control over the mouse pointer . with larger movements of the physical device , you can move the mouse pointer rapidly to different areas on the screen . 
double click interval : 
the double click interval is the maximal time ( in milliseconds ) between two mouse clicks which turns them into a double click . if the second click happens later than this time interval after the first click , they are recognized as two separate clicks . 
drag start time : 
if you click with the mouse ( e . g . in a multi - line editor ) and begin to move the mouse within the drag start time , a drag operation will be initiated . 
drag start distance : 
if you click with the mouse and begin to move the mouse at least the drag start distance , a drag operation will be initiated . 
mouse wheel scrolls by : 
if you use the wheel of a mouse , this value determines the number of lines to scroll for each wheel movement . note that if this number exceeds the number of visible lines , it will be ignored and the wheel movement will be handled as a page up / down movement .

service manager this module allows you to have an overview of all plugins of the kde daemon , also referred to as kde services . generally , there are two types of service : services invoked at startup services called on demand the latter are only listed for convenience . the startup services can be started and stopped . in administrator mode , you can also define whether services should be loaded at startup . use this with care : some services are vital for kde ; do not deactivate services if you do not know what you are doing .

keyboard repeat
if you check this option , pressing and holding down a key emits the same character over and over again . for example , pressing and holding down the tab key will have the same effect as that of pressing that key several times in succession : tab characters continue to be emitted until you release the key . 
& enable keyboard repeat
if supported , this option allows you to set the delay after which a pressed key will start generating keycodes . the ' repeat rate ' option controls the frequency of these keycodes . 
if supported , this option allows you to set the rate at which keycodes are generated while a key is pressed . 
if supported , this option allows you to hear audible clicks from your computer ' s speakers when you press the keys on your keyboard . this might be useful if your keyboard does not have mechanical keys , or if the sound that the keys make is very soft . you can change the loudness of the key click feedback by dragging the slider button or by clicking the up / down arrows on the spin box . setting the volume to 0 % turns off the key click .

duplicate identification
browser identification the browser - identification module allows you to have full control over how konqueror will identify itself to web sites you browse . this ability to fake identification is necessary because some web sites do not display properly when they detect that they are not talking to current versions of either netscape navigator or internet explorer , even if the browser actually supports all the necessary features to render those pages properly . for such sites , you can use this feature to try to browse them . please understand that this might not always work , since such sites might be using non - standard web protocols and or specifications . note : to obtain specific help on a particular section of the dialog box , simply click on the quick help button on the window title bar , then click on the section for which you are seeking help .

if this option is enabled , kde will look for new netscape plugins every time it starts up . this makes it easier for you if you often install new plugins , but it may also slow down kde startup . you might want to disable this option , especially if you seldom install plugins . 
scan for new plugins at & kde startup
enhanced browsing in this module you can configure some enhanced browsing features of kde . web shortcuts web shortcuts are a quick way of using web search engines . for example , type " altavista : frobozz " or " av : frobozz " and konqueror will do a search on altavista for " frobozz " . even easier : just press alt + f2 ( if you have not changed this shortcut ) and enter the shortcut in the kde run command dialog .

search & uri : 
enter the uri that is used to do a search on the search engine here . the whole text to be searched for can be specified as \\ { @ } or \\ { 0 } . recommended is \\ { @ } , since it removes all query variables ( name = value ) from the resulting string whereas \\ { 0 } will be substituted with the unmodified query string . you can use \\ { 1 } . . . \\ { n } to specify certain words from the query and \\ { name } to specify a value given by ' name = value ' in the user query . in addition it is possible to specify multiple references ( names , numbers and strings ) at once ( \\ { name1 , name2 , . . . , " string " } ) . the first matching value ( from the left ) will be used as substitution value for the resulting uri . a quoted string can be used as default value if nothing matches from the left of the reference list . 
search & provider name : 
the shortcuts entered here can be used as a pseudo - uri scheme in kde . for example , the shortcut av can be used as in av : my search
uri shortcuts : 
select the character set that will be used to encode your search query . 
in this module you can configure the web shortcuts feature . web shortcuts allow you to quickly search or lookup words on the internet . for example , to search for information about the kde project using the google engine , you simply type gg : kde or google : kde . if you select a default search engine , normal words or phrases will be looked up at the specified search engine by simply typing them into applications , such as konqueror , that have built - in support for such a feature .

& shorturls
_ : note _ to _ the _ translators by default , the web shortcuts will all go to the international versions of each site ( e . g . google . com ) , not to the local site ( e . g . google . de ) . to change this , add extra ' query [ foo ] = . . . ' lines to the . desktop files in kdebase / kcontrol / ebrowsing / plugins / ikws / searchproviders . for example , in google . desktop , copy the original query = . . . line to query [ foo ] = . . . and change its url so it uses google . foo instead of google . com . ( translate this message as done when you have added the extra query urls ; otherwise , leave it untranslated as a reminder . )

for selecting a specific window in an application , both window class and window role should be selected . window class will determine the application , and window role the specific window in the application ; many applications do not provide useful window roles though . 
use window class and window & role ( specific window ) 
with some ( non - kde ) applications whole window class can be sufficient for selecting a specific window in an application , as they set whole window class to contain both application and window role .

this option specifies how much kwin will try to prevent unwanted focus stealing caused by unexpected activation of new windows . ( note : this feature does not work with the focus under mouse or focus strictly under mouse focus policies . ) none : prevention is turned off and new windows always become activated . low : prevention is enabled ; when some window does not have support for the underlying mechanism and kwin cannot reliably decide whether to activate the window or not , it will be activated . this setting may have both worse and better results than the medium level , depending on the applications . medium : prevention is enabled . high : new windows get activated only if no window is currently active or if they belong to the currently active application . this setting is probably not really usable when not using mouse focus policy . extreme : all windows must be explicitly activated by the user . windows that are prevented from stealing focus are marked as demanding attention , which by default means their taskbar entry will be highlighted . this can be changed in the notifications control module . 
focus stealing prevention level : 
click to focus
focus follows mouse
focus under mouse
focus strictly under mouse
the focus policy is used to determine the active window , i . e . the window you can work in . click to focus : a window becomes active when you click into it . this is the behavior you might know from other operating systems . focus follows mouse : moving the mouse pointer actively on to a normal window activates it . new windows will receive the focus , without you having to point the mouse at them explicitly . very practical if you are using the mouse a lot . focus under mouse : the window that happens to be under the mouse pointer is active . if the mouse points nowhere , the last window that was under the mouse has focus . new windows will not automatically receive the focus . focus strictly under mouse : only the window under the mouse pointer is active . if the mouse points nowhere , nothing has focus . note that ' focus under mouse ' and ' focus strictly under mouse ' prevent certain features such as the alt + tab walk through windows dialog in the kde mode from working properly . 
ms
delay focus by : 
click raises active window
when this option is enabled , a window in the background will automatically come to the front when the mouse pointer has been over it for some time . 
this is the delay after which the window that the mouse pointer is over will automatically come to the front . 
when this option is enabled , the active window will be brought to the front when you click somewhere into the window contents . to change it for inactive windows , you need to change the settings in the actions tab . 
when this option is enabled , there will be a delay after which the window the mouse pointer is over will become active ( receive focus ) . 
this is the delay after which the window the mouse pointer is over will automatically receive focus .

enable this option if you want a window ' s content to be shown while resizing it , instead of just showing a window ' skeleton ' . the result may not be satisfying on slow machines . 
display window & geometry when moving or resizing
enable this option if you want a window ' s geometry to be displayed while it is being moved or resized . the window position relative to the top - left corner of the screen is displayed together with its size . 
allow moving and resizing of maximized windows
when enabled , this feature activates the border of maximized windows and allows you to move or resize them , just like for normal windows

kde performance you can configure settings that improve kde performance here . 
konqueror performance you can configure several settings that improve konqueror performance here . these include options for reusing already running instances and for keeping instances preloaded . 
disables the minimization of memory usage and allows you to make each browsing activity independent from the others
with this option activated , only one instance of konqueror used for file browsing will exist in the memory of your computer at any moment , no matter how many file browsing windows you open , thus reducing resource requirements . be aware that this also means that , if something goes wrong , all your file browsing windows will be closed simultaneously
with this option activated , only one instance of konqueror will exist in the memory of your computer at any moment , no matter how many browsing windows you open , thus reducing resource requirements . be aware that this also means that , if something goes wrong , all your browsing windows will be closed simultaneously . 
if non - zero , this option allows keeping konqueror instances in memory after all their windows have been closed , up to the number specified in this option . when a new konqueror instance is needed , one of these preloaded instances will be reused instead , improving responsiveness at the expense of the memory required by the preloaded instances . 
if enabled , an instance of konqueror will be preloaded after the ordinary kde startup sequence . this will make the first konqueror window open faster , but at the expense of longer kde startup times ( but you will be able to work while it is loading , so you may not even notice that it is taking longer ) . 
if enabled , kde will always try to have one preloaded konqueror instance ready ; preloading a new instance in the background whenever there is not one available , so that windows will always open quickly . warning : in some cases , it is actually possible that this will reduce perceived performance . 
minimize memory usage
for & file browsing only ( recommended ) 
always ( use with care ) 
preloading
maximum number of instances kept & preloaded : 
preload an instance after kde startup
always try to have at least one preloaded instance
system configuration
this option may in rare cases lead to various problems . consult the what ' s this ( shift + f1 ) help for details . 
during startup kde needs to perform a check of its system configuration ( mimetypes , installed applications , etc . ) , and in case the configuration has changed since the last time , the system configuration cache ( ksycoca ) needs to be updated . this option delays the check , which avoid scanning all directories containing files describing the system during kde startup , thus making kde startup faster . however , in the rare case the system configuration has changed since the last time , and the change is needed before this delayed check takes place , this option may lead to various problems ( missing applications in the k menu , reports from applications about missing required mimetypes , etc . ) . changes of system configuration mostly happen by ( un ) installing applications . it is therefore recommended to turn this option temporarily off while ( un ) installing applications .

possible reasons
1 ) the kde daemon , ' kded ' is not running . you can restart it by running the command ' kdeinit ' and then try reloading the kde system settings to see if this message goes away . 2 ) you do not appear to have smartcard support in the kde libraries . you will need to recompile the kdelibs package with libpcsclite installed . 
smartcard support
& enable smartcard support
enable & polling to autodetect card events
in most cases you should have this enabled . it allows kde to automatically detect card insertion and reader hotplug events .

when enabled , all popup menus will have a drop - shadow , otherwise drop - shadows will not be displayed . at present , only kde styles can have this effect enabled . 
software tint : alpha - blend using a flat color . software blend : alpha - blend using an image . xrender blend : use the xfree render extension for image blending ( if available ) . this method may be slower than the software routines on non - accelerated displays , but may however improve performance on remote displays . 
by adjusting this slider you can control the menu effect opacity . 
note : that all widgets in this combobox do not apply to qt - only applications . 
if you check this box , the toolbars will be transparent when moving them around . 
if you enable this option some pop - up menus will show so called tear - off handles . if you click them , you get the menu inside a widget . this can be very helpful when performing the same action multiple times .

enable background
if this is checked , kdm will use the settings below for the background . if it is disabled , you have to look after the background yourself . this is done by running some program ( possibly xsetroot ) in the script specified in the setup = option in kdmrc ( usually xsetup ) . 
attention read help
enable auto - login
turn on the auto - login feature . this applies only to kdm ' s graphical login . think twice before enabling this ! 
select the user to be logged in automatically . 
preselect user
previous
preselect the user that logged in previously . use this if this computer is usually used several consecutive times by one user . 
specified : 
preselect the user specified in the combo box to the right . use this if this computer is predominantly used by a certain user . 
select the user to be preselected for login . this box is editable , so you can specify an arbitrary non - existent user to mislead possible attackers . 
focus password
when this option is on , kdm will place the cursor in the password field instead of the user field after preselecting a user . use this to save one key press per login , if the preselection usually does not need to be changed . 
enable password - less logins
when this option is checked , the checked users from the list below will be allowed to log in without entering their password . this applies only to kdm ' s graphical login . think twice before enabling this ! 
no password required for : 
check all users you want to allow a password - less login for . entries denoted with ' @ ' are user groups . checking a group is like checking all users in that group . 
automatically log in again after & x server crash
when this option is on , a user will be logged in again automatically when their session is interrupted by an x server crash ; note that this can open a security hole : if you use a screen locker than kde ' s integrated one , this will make circumventing a password - secured screen lock possible . 
& greeting : 
this is the " headline " for kdm ' s login window . you may want to put some nice greeting or information about the operating system here . kdm will substitute the following character pairs with the respective contents : % d - > current display % h - > host name , possibly with domain name % n - > node name , most probably the host name without domain name % s - > the operating system % r - > the operating system ' s version % m - > the machine ( hardware ) type % % - > a single %

show list
if this option is checked , kdm will show a list of users , so users can click on their name or image rather than typing in their login . 
if this option is checked , kdm will automatically complete user names while they are typed in the line edit . 
inverse selection
this option specifies how the users for " show list " and " autocompletion " are selected in the " select users and groups " list : if not checked , select only the checked users . if checked , select all non - system users , except the checked ones . 
sort users
if this is checked , kdm will alphabetically sort the user list . otherwise users are listed in the order they appear in the password file . 
select users and groups : 
selected users
kdm will show all checked users . entries denoted with ' @ ' are user groups . checking a group is like checking all users in that group . 
kdm will show all non - checked non - system users . entries denoted with ' @ ' are user groups . checking a group is like checking all users in that group . 
user image source
here you can specify where kdm will obtain the images that represent users . " system " represents the global folder ; these are the pictures you can set below .

kde login manager config module
( c ) 1996 - 2008 the kdm authors
login manager in this module you can configure the various aspects of the kde login manager . this includes the look and feel as well as the users that can be selected for login . note that you can only make changes if you run the module with superuser rights . if you have not started the kde system settings with superuser rights ( which is absolutely the right thing to do , by the way ) , click on the modify button to acquire superuser rights . you will be asked for the superuser password . general on this tab page , you can configure parts of the login manager ' s look , and which language it should use . the language settings made here have no influence on the user ' s language settings . dialog here you can configure the look of the " classical " dialog based mode if you have chosen to use it . background if you want to set a special background for the dialog based login screen , this is where to do it . themes here you can specify a theme to be used by the login manager . shutdown here you can specify who is allowed to shutdown / reboot the machine and whether a boot manager should be used . users on this tab page , you can select which users the login manager will offer you for logging in . convenience here you can specify a user to be logged in automatically , users not needing to provide a password to log in , and other convenience features . note , that these settings are security holes by their nature , so use them very carefully .

please note that any open applications will need to be restarted in order for any changes to be noticed . ( you will also have to restart this application in order to use its print function on any newly installed fonts . ) 
configure fonts for legacy x applications
modern applications use a system called " fontconfig " to obtain the list of fonts . older applications , such as openoffice 1 . x , gimp 1 . x , etc . use the previous " core x fonts " mechanism for this . selecting this option will inform the installer to create the necessary files so that these older applications can use the fonts you install . please note , however , that this will slow down the installation process . 
configure fonts for ghostscript
when printing , most applications create what is know as postscript . this is then sent to a special application , named ghostscript , which can interpret the postscript and send the appropriate instructions to your printer . if your application does not embed whatever fonts it uses into the postscript , then ghostscript needs to be informed as to which fonts you have installed , and where they are located . selecting this option will create the necessary ghostscript config files . please note , however , that this will also slow down the installation process . as most applications can , and do , embed the fonts into the postscript before sending this to ghostscript , this option can safely be disabled .

this option prevents the selection being recorded in the clipboard history . only explicit clipboard changes are recorded . 
there are two different clipboard buffers available : clipboard is filled by selecting something and pressing ctrl + c , or by clicking " copy " in a toolbar or menubar . selection is available immediately after selecting some text . the only way to access the selection is to press the middle mouse button . you can configure the relationship between clipboard and selection . 
action list ( right click to add / remove commands ) : 
double - click here to set the command to be executed
double - click here to set the regular expression
selecting this option synchronizes these two buffers . 
using this option will only set the selection when highlighting something and the clipboard when choosing e . g . " copy " in a menubar .

tips & tricks
use web - shortcuts : by typing " gg : kde " one can search the internet , using google , for the search phrase " kde " . there are a lot of web - shortcuts predefined to make searching for software or looking up certain words in an encyclopedia a breeze . you can even create your own web - shortcuts . 
use the magnifier button in the toolbar to increase the font size on your web page . 
when you want to paste a new address into the location toolbar you might want to clear the current entry by pressing the black arrow with the white cross in the toolbar . 
to create a link on your desktop pointing to the current page , simply drag the " location " label that is to the left of the location toolbar , drop it on to the desktop , and choose " link " . 
you can also find " full - screen mode " in the settings menu . this feature is very useful for " talk " sessions . 
divide et impera ( lat . " divide and conquer " ) - by splitting a window into two parts ( e . g . window - > split view left / right ) you can make konqueror appear the way you like . you can even load some example view - profiles ( e . g . midnight commander ) , or create your own ones . 
use the user - agent feature if the website you are visiting asks you to use a different browser ( and do not forget to send a complaint to the webmaster ! ) 
the history in your sidebar ensures that you can keep track of the pages you have visited recently . 
use a caching proxy to speed up your internet connection . 
advanced users will appreciate the konsole which you can embed into konqueror ( settings - > show terminal emulator ) .

enable shortcuts that allow you to quickly search for information on the web . for example , entering the shortcut gg : kde will result in a search for the word kde on the google ( tm ) search engine . 
enter the human - readable name of the search provider here . 
enter the uri that is used to perform a search on the search engine here . the whole text to be searched for can be specified as \\ { @ } or \\ { 0 } . recommended is \\ { @ } , since it removes all query variables ( name = value ) from the resulting string , whereas \\ { 0 } will be substituted with the unmodified query string . you can use \\ { 1 } . . . \\ { n } to specify certain words from the query and \\ { name } to specify a value given by ' name = value ' in the user query . in addition it is possible to specify multiple references ( names , numbers and strings ) at once ( \\ { name1 , name2 , . . . , " string " } ) . the first matching value ( from the left ) will be used as the substitution value for the resulting uri . a quoted string can be used as the default value if nothing matches from the left of the reference list .

keyboard layout here you can choose your keyboard layout and model . the ' model ' refers to the type of keyboard that is connected to your computer , while the keyboard layout defines " which key does what " and may be different for different countries . 
keyboard & model : 
here you can choose a keyboard model . this setting is independent of your keyboard layout and refers to the " hardware " model , i . e . the way your keyboard is manufactured . modern keyboards that come with your computer usually have two extra keys and are referred to as " 104 - key " models , which is probably what you want if you do not know what kind of keyboard you have . 
available layouts : 
active layouts : 
layout variant : 
here you can choose a variant of selected keyboard layout . layout variants usually represent different key maps for the same language . for example , ukrainian layout might have four variants : basic , winkeys ( as in windows ) , typewriter ( as in typewriters ) and phonetic ( each ukrainian letter is placed on a transliterated latin one ) . 
switching options
if you select " application " or " window " switching policy , changing the keyboard layout will only affect the current application or window .

shortcuts for switching layout
& reset old options
this is the command which will be executed to initialize configured options . 
here you can set xkb extension options instead of , or in addition to , specifying them in the x11 configuration file . 
xkb options
add > > 
< < remove
this is the command which is executed when switching to the selected layout . it may help you if you want to debug layout switching , or if you want to switch layouts without the help of kde . 
sticky switching
if you have more than two layouts and turn this option on , switching with the keyboard shortcut or clicking on the kxkb indicator will only cycle through the last few layouts . you can specify the number of layouts to rotate below . you can still access all layouts by right - clicking on the kxkb indicator . 
enable sticky switching

switch keyboard layout
if more than one layout is present in this list , the kde panel will offer a docked flag . by clicking on this flag you can easily switch between layouts . the first layout will be default one .

change scheduling priority for : 
cpu scheduler
p , li { white - space : pre - wrap ; } the standard time - sharing scheduler for processes without special requirements . 
p , li { white - space : pre - wrap ; } normal scheduling : default linux time - sharing ( other ) normal is the standard linux time - sharing scheduler that is intended for all processes that do not require special static priority real - time mechanisms . the process to run is chosen from the list of other normal or batch processes based on a dynamic priority that is determined only inside this list . the dynamic priority is based on the priority level given and increased for each time - quantum the process is ready to run , but denied to run by the scheduler . this ensures fair progress among all normal processes . 
p , li { white - space : pre - wrap ; } for cpu - intensive non - interactive processes . process is mildly disfavored in scheduling decisions . 
p , li { white - space : pre - wrap ; } batch scheduling ( since linux 2.6.16 . ) this policy is similar to normal , except that this policy will cause the scheduler to always assume that the process is cpu - intensive . consequently , the scheduler will apply a small scheduling penalty so that this process is mildly disfavored in scheduling decisions . this policy is useful for workloads that are non - interactive , but do not want to lower their nice value , and for workloads that want a deterministic scheduling policy without interactivity causing extra preemptions ( between the workload ' s tasks ) . 
p , li { white - space : pre - wrap ; } process will run whenever runnable . higher priority than normal or batch . has timeslicing . 
p , li { white - space : pre - wrap ; } round robin scheduling round robin is a simple enhancement of fifo . everything described below for fifo also applies to round robin , except that each process is only allowed to run for a maximum time quantum . 
p , li { white - space : pre - wrap ; } process will run whenever runnable . higher priority than normal or batch . no timeslicing . 
p , li { white - space : pre - wrap ; } first in - first out scheduling when a fifo process becomes runnable , it will always immediately preempt any currently running normal or batch process . 
p , li { white - space : pre - wrap ; } process ' s priority is based on the cpu priority . 
p , li { white - space : pre - wrap ; } normal scheduling this is the same as best effort scheduling , except that the priority is calculated automatically based on the cpu priority . processes with a higher priority will take priority for access to the hard disk . programs running at the same best effort / normal priority are served in a round robin fashion . 
p , li { white - space : pre - wrap ; } process can only use the hard disk when no other process has used it very recently . 
p , li { white - space : pre - wrap ; } idle scheduling a program running with idle i / o priority will only get disk time when no other program has asked for disk i / o for a defined grace period . the impact of idle i / o processes on normal system activity should be zero . priority is not applicable to this scheduling class . 
p , li { white - space : pre - wrap ; } process is given higher priority to access the hard disk than normal . 
p , li { white - space : pre - wrap ; } best effort scheduling processes with a higher priority will take priority for access to the hard disk . programs running at the same best effort / normal priority are served in a round robin fashion . 
p , li { white - space : pre - wrap ; } process gets immediate access to the hard disk whenever needed , regardless of what else is going on . 
p , li { white - space : pre - wrap ; } real time scheduling the real time scheduling class is given first access to the disk , regardless of what else is going on in the system . thus the real time class needs to be used with some care , as it can starve other processes . as with the best effort class , 8 priority levels are defined denoting how big a time slice a given process will receive on each scheduling window .

type accented & letters
if this is checked , you have to type accented letters yourself ( i . e . they are differentiated from the corresponding unaccented letter ) . 
if this is disabled , the selected language does not support it . if this is enabledand if you check it , then you should type accented letters on their own . if it is not checked , accented letters will be displayed with normal letters ( default ) . for example , in catalan , if this is unchecked and you type " o " , the o and ò will be displayed in the word xenofòbia . if this option is checked , when you type " o " , only " o " will be displayed and you will have to type " ò " for this letter to be displayed . 
if checked , the word will be displayed all in upper case letters
check this if you do not want to discover each instance of the same letter . 
if you check this box , only the first letter will be written if the letter is found in several places in the word . then you have to rechoose the same letter , to replace the second instance in the word until there are no more instances of this letter . for example , the word to guess is " potato " . if this option is unchecked , when you try " o " , the two instances of " o " in the word will be discovered at the same time . if this is checked , you will need to try " o " twice . default is that for one letter typed , all instances of that letter in the word are discovered . 
require more guesses for duplicate letters

one of the most powerful tools in kig are the menus that you can enter by right - clicking on an object , or on some empty space in the document . you can use them to give objects names , change their colors and line styles , and lots of other interesting things . 
you can construct new points without using the menu or the toolbar , simply clicking somewhere on the kig document with the middle mouse button . 
kig can open several file formats : its files ( . kig files ) , kgeo files , kseg files , and , partially , dr . geo and cabri # 8482 ; files . 
kig has more than 20 objects and 10 transformations with more than 80 constructions you can use in your documents : open the objects menu to see them all . 
you can use the selected objects to start the construction of an object which requires the selected objects as arguments . for example , if you have two points selected , you can choose start - > circle by three points from the popup menu to start constructing a circle by three points . 
when you construct a locus , you can click on it with the right mouse button and select cartesian equation to see its cartesian equation , whenever it is an algebraic curve of low degree .

welcome to the kstars telescope setup wizard ! this wizard will help you to connect to your telescope and control it from kstars . you will be asked to verify some basic information . you can get extended information on telescope support in kstars by pressing the help button at any point during the wizard . please click next to continue . 
1 . telescope model please select your telescope model from the list below . click next after selecting a model . 
tip some non - meade telescopes support a subset of the lx200 command set . select lx200 basic to control such devices . 
2 . align your telescope you need to align your telescope before you can control it properly from kstars . please refer to your telescope manual for alignment instructions . after a successful alignment , connect your telescope ' s rs232 interface to your computer ' s serial or usb port . click next to continue . 
3 . verify local settings verify if the following time , date , and location settings are correct . if any of the settings are incorrect , you can correct them via the set time and set location buttons . 
set time . . .

reporting new timestep value : 
adjust time step
adjust time step units
set the timescale for the simulation clock . a setting of " 1 sec " means the clock advances in real - time , keeping up perfectly with your cpu clock . higher values make the simulation clock run faster , lower values make it run slower . negative values make it run backwards . there are two pairs of up / down buttons . the left pair will cycle through all available timesteps in sequence . since there are a large number of timesteps , the right pair is provided to skip to the next higher / lower unit of time . for example , if the timescale is currently " 1 min " , the right up button will make it " 1 hour " , and the right down button will make it " 1 sec "

the column to the left of the 1 requires a quick run down and back up , with careful dodging both ways to avoid the enemies . to get the gold in the middle of the 6 , drop down on the top of the ' o ' part of the 6 , move right / dig left and immediately move left and dig left to delay the enemy who otherwise is likely to catch you . however , you may wish to leave this piece of gold to the end so as not to free two additional enemies earlier ; it is possible to get two enemies to retrap themselves in that section , though . to get the gold held by enemies in the bottom right , dig out the blocking square to their left , run up the ladder , dig off the right side of the 6 , drop in , run left and dig off a square on the left side of the 6 and drop to the floor . the timing is tight - only one or two enemies in the bottom right section will be able to move to the next section to the left . you will still need to dig out the bottom of the 6 to get their gold , but that is straightforward albeit a bit hectic because of the enemies lingering to the left of the 6 . once you have gotten all the gold , you may find it easiest to exit by passing through the middle false floor on the 1 and exiting via the ladders on the left of the 1 . 
translators : please see the notes in the translation comment . 
these levels were composed by marco krüger , the original author of the kgoldrunner program , and some of his friends and contributors . they use kgoldrunner rules . the enemies run fast and have an aggressive search strategy . enjoy !

this tutorial is preparation for some of the things you might find in the middle levels of the ' initiation ' game . enjoy . . . 
bars and ladders
there is nowhere to dig , so you must dodge the enemies and avoid falling to the concrete at the wrong time . try to keep the enemies together . if an enemy has gold coloring , he is holding a nugget . he might drop it as he runs over the concrete or maybe at the top of a ladder . . . patience , patience ! 
to kill . . . 
you cannot get up to the gold , so you must get the enemies to bring it down to you . but how do you get them to keep going back ? if you are feeling stressed , you can hit the pause key ( default p or esc ) and take a break . also , you can use the settings menu to slow down the action . 
. . . or not to kill ? 
it is best not to kill the enemy . try it and you will find out why . . . heh , heh , heh ! if you do kill him unintentionally , before you have collected the gold at the top left , you can still finish the level by digging away the side of the pit he is in . 
traps
some of the bricks here are not what they seem . they are known as false bricks , fall - through bricks or traps . if you try to walk on them , you fall through . if the enemies walk on them , they can descend on you without warning . sometimes you have to fall through a brick to get some gold . at the start , jump into the concrete pit , dig and drop through . that will get one enemy tied up for a while . . . 
bye . . . 
this is just a nice easy level to finish up with . have fun with the other games in kgoldrunner . note that there is a game editor in which you and your friends can make up levels and challenge each other . and if you like action , the kgoldrunner rules used in some of the games are fast and furious . there is also a kgoldrunner handbook in the help menu , which contains more detail than this tutorial . it has been a pleasure showing you around . bye ! 
this tutorial is a collection of easy levels that teaches you the rules of kgoldrunner and helps you develop the skills you need to get started . it uses the traditional set of rules , similar to those used on early home - computers . each level has a brief explanation , then you play . . . when you move on to play more advanced levels , you will find that kgoldrunner combines action , strategy and puzzle solving - - - all in one game . 
hi ! 
hi ! welcome to kgoldrunner ! the idea of the game is to pick up all the gold nuggets , then climb to the top of the playing area and move up to the next level . a hidden ladder will appear as you collect the last nugget . the hero , at the top left , is your deputy . to collect the nuggets , just point the mouse where you want him to go . at first gravity takes over and he falls . . . 
this is an exercise in moving around . follow the track of gold nuggets until the ladder pops up at the right . the hero can only follow the mouse along simple paths ( like _ _ bar _ l or u ) , so be careful not to get too far ahead of him . danger : try not to fall off the ladder or bar into the concrete pit at the bottom right . if you do get trapped there , the only way out is to kill the hero ( press key q for quit ) and start the level again . 
digging
now you have to dig to get the gold ! just use the left and right mouse buttons to dig left or right of the hero ' s position . the hero can then jump into and through the hole he has dug . he can also dig several holes in a row and run sideways through the dug holes . be careful though . after a while the holes close up and you can get trapped and killed . in the third box down , you have to dig two holes , jump in and quickly dig one more , to get through two layers . on the right , you have to dig three , then two then one to get through . there are also two little puzzles to work out along the way . good luck ! by the way , you can dig through brick , but not concrete . 
you have enemies ! 
well , it has been nice and easy up to now , but the game would be no fun without enemies . they are after the gold too : worse still they are after you ! you die if they catch you , but maybe you will have a few lives left and can start again . you can handle enemies by running away , digging a hole or luring them into part of the playing area where they get stranded . if an enemy falls into a hole , he gives up any gold he is carrying , then gets stuck in the hole for a time and climbs out . if the hole closes while he is in it , he dies and reappears somewhere else on the screen . you can deliberately kill enemies by digging several holes in a row . more importantly , you can run over an enemy ' s head . you should do that right at the start of this level . dig a hole , trap the enemy , wait for him to fall all the way in , then run over him , with the other enemy in hot pursuit . . . if you are feeling stressed , you can hit the pause key at any time ( default p or esc ) and take a break . hit it again when you wish to continue . 
you can move horizontally along bars ( or poles ) , but if you move down you will let go and fall . . . also , note that you can collect gold by falling onto it . 
false bricks
some of the bricks in this level are not what they seem . if you walk onto them you fall through . the enemies fall through them too . 
these tricky little levels were composed by peter , simon , genevieve and their father ian wadham . they use traditional playing rules . enjoy !

gamma correction is not supported by your graphics hardware or driver . 
monitor gamma this is a tool for changing monitor gamma correction . use the four sliders to define the gamma correction either as a single value , or separately for the red , green and blue components . you may need to correct the brightness and contrast settings of your monitor for good results . the test images help you to find proper settings . you can save them system - wide to xf86config ( root access is required for that ) or to your own kde settings . on multi head systems you can correct the gamma values separately for all screens .

cannot open resource for reading
this means that the contents of the requested file or folder % 1 could not be retrieved , as read access could not be obtained . 
you may not have permissions to read the file or open the folder . 
cannot open resource for writing
this means that the file , % 1 , could not be written to as requested , because access with permission to write could not be obtained . 
cannot initiate the % 1 protocol
unable to launch process
the program on your computer which provides access to the % 1 protocol could not be started . this is usually due to technical reasons . 
the program which provides compatibility with this protocol may not have been updated with your last update of kde . this can cause the program to be incompatible with the current version and thus not start . 
the program on your computer which provides access to the % 1 protocol has reported an internal error . 
improperly formatted url
the u niform r esource l ocator ( url ) that you entered was not properly formatted . the format of a url is generally as follows : protocol : / / user : password @ www . example . org : port / folder / filename . extension ? query = value
unsupported protocol % 1
the protocol % 1 is not supported by the kde programs currently installed on this computer . 
the requested protocol may not be supported . 
the versions of the % 1 protocol supported by this computer and the server may be incompatible . 
you may perform a search on the internet for a kde program ( called a kioslave or ioslave ) which supports this protocol . places to search include http : / / kde - apps . org / and http : / / freshmeat . net / . 
url does not refer to a resource . 
protocol is a filter protocol
the u niform r esource l ocator ( url ) that you entered did not refer to a specific resource . 
kde is able to communicate through a protocol within a protocol ; the protocol specified is only for use in such situations , however this is not one of these situations . this is a rare event , and is likely to indicate a programming error . 
unsupported action : % 1
the requested action is not supported by the kde program which is implementing the % 1 protocol . 
this error is very much dependent on the kde program . the additional information should give you more information than is available to the kde input / output architecture . 
attempt to find another way to accomplish the same outcome . 
file expected
the request expected a file , however the folder % 1 was found instead . 
this may be an error on the server side . 
folder expected
the request expected a folder , however the file % 1 was found instead . 
file or folder does not exist
the specified file or folder % 1 does not exist . 
the requested file could not be created because a file with the same name already exists . 
try moving the current file out of the way first , and then try again . 
delete the current file and try again . 
choose an alternate filename for the new file . 
the requested folder could not be created because a folder with the same name already exists . 
try moving the current folder out of the way first , and then try again . 
delete the current folder and try again .

unable to enter folder
this means that an attempt to enter ( in other words , to open ) the requested folder % 1 was rejected . 
folder listing unavailable
protocol % 1 is not a filesystem
this means that a request was made which requires determining the contents of the folder , and the kde program supporting this protocol is unable to do so . 
cyclic link detected
unix environments are commonly able to link a file or folder to a separate name and / or location . kde detected a link or series of links that results in an infinite loop - i . e . the file was ( perhaps in a roundabout way ) linked to itself . 
delete one part of the loop in order that it does not cause an infinite loop , and try again . 
request aborted by user
the request was not completed because it was aborted . 
retry the request . 
cyclic link detected during copy
unix environments are commonly able to link a file or folder to a separate name and / or location . during the requested copy operation , kde detected a link or series of links that results in an infinite loop - i . e . the file was ( perhaps in a roundabout way ) linked to itself . 
could not create network connection
could not create socket
this is a fairly technical error in which a required device for network communications ( a socket ) could not be created . 
the network connection may be incorrectly configured , or the network interface may not be enabled .

a network firewall ( a device which restricts internet requests ) , either protecting your network or the network of the server , may have intervened , preventing this request . 
connection to server closed unexpectedly
although a connection was established to % 1 , the connection was closed at an unexpected point in the communication . 
a protocol error may have occurred , causing the server to close the connection as a response to the error . 
url resource invalid
protocol % 1 is not a filter protocol
the u niform r esource l ocator ( url ) that you entered did not refer to a valid mechanism of accessing the specific resource , % 1 % 2 . 
kde is able to communicate through a protocol within a protocol . this request specified a protocol be used as such , however this protocol is not capable of such an action . this is a rare event , and is likely to indicate a programming error . 
unable to initialize input / output device
could not mount device
the requested device could not be initialized ( " mounted " ) . the reported error was : % 1
the device may not be ready , for example there may be no media in a removable media device ( i . e . no cd - rom in a cd drive ) , or in the case of a peripheral / portable device , the device may not be correctly connected . 
you may not have permissions to initialize ( " mount " ) the device . on unix systems , often system administrator privileges are required to initialize a device . 
check that the device is ready ; removable drives must contain media , and portable devices must be connected and powered on . ; and try again . 
unable to uninitialize input / output device
could not unmount device
the requested device could not be uninitialized ( " unmounted " ) . the reported error was : % 1
the device may be busy , that is , still in use by another application or user . even such things as having an open browser window on a location on this device may cause the device to remain in use . 
you may not have permissions to uninitialize ( " unmount " ) the device . on unix systems , system administrator privileges are often required to uninitialize a device . 
check that no applications are accessing the device , and try again . 
cannot read from resource
this means that although the resource , % 1 , was able to be opened , an error occurred while reading the contents of the resource . 
you may not have permissions to read from the resource . 
cannot write to resource
this means that although the resource , % 1 , was able to be opened , an error occurred while writing to the resource . 
you may not have permissions to write to the resource . 
could not listen for network connections
could not bind
this is a fairly technical error in which a required device for network communications ( a socket ) could not be established to listen for incoming network connections . 
could not listen
could not accept network connection
this is a fairly technical error in which an error occurred while attempting to accept an incoming network connection . 
you may not have permissions to accept the connection .

unexpected program termination
the program on your computer which provides access to the % 1 protocol has unexpectedly terminated . 
the program on your computer which provides access to the % 1 protocol could not obtain the memory required to continue . 
unknown proxy host
while retrieving information about the specified proxy host , % 1 , an unknown host error was encountered . an unknown host error indicates that the requested name could not be located on the internet . 
there may have been a problem with your network configuration , specifically your proxy ' s hostname . if you have been accessing the internet with no problems recently , this is unlikely . 
double - check your proxy settings and try again . 
authentication failed : method % 1 not supported
although you may have supplied the correct authentication details , the authentication failed because the method that the server is using is not supported by the kde program implementing the protocol % 1 . 
please file a bug at http : / / bugs . kde . org / to inform the kde team of the unsupported authentication method . 
request aborted
internal error in server
the program on the server which provides access to the % 1 protocol has reported an internal error : % 2 . 
this is most likely to be caused by a bug in the server program . please consider submitting a full bug report as detailed below . 
contact the administrator of the server to advise them of the problem . 
if you know who the authors of the server software are , submit the bug report directly to them . 
timeout error
although contact was made with the server , a response was not received within the amount of time allocated for the request as follows : timeout for establishing a connection : % 1 seconds timeout for receiving a response : % 2 seconds timeout for accessing proxy servers : % 3 seconds please note that you can alter these timeout settings in the kde system settings , by selecting network settings - > connection preferences . 
the server was too busy responding to other requests to respond .

could not rename original file
the requested operation required the renaming of the original file % 1 , however it could not be renamed . 
could not rename temporary file
the requested operation required the creation of a temporary file % 1 , however it could not be created . 
could not create symbolic link
the requested symbolic link % 1 could not be created . 
no content
disk full
the requested file % 1 could not be written to as there is inadequate disk space . 
free up enough disk space by 1 ) deleting unwanted and temporary files ; 2 ) archiving files to removable media storage such as cd - recordable discs ; or 3 ) obtain more storage capacity .

uninvited connections
allow & uninvited connections
select this option to allow connecting without inviting . this is useful if you want to access your desktop remotely . 
announce service & on the network
if you allow uninvited connections and enable this option , desktop sharing will announce the service and your identity on the local network , so people can find you and your computer . 
confirm uninvited connections & before accepting
if enabled , a dialog will appear when somebody attempts to connect , asking you whether you want to accept the connection . 
allow uninvited connections to control the desktop
enable this option to allow uninvited user to control your desktop ( using mouse and keyboard ) . 
if you allow uninvited connections , it is highly recommended to set a password in order to protect your computer from unauthorized access . 
& session
session preferences
always disable & background image
check this option to always disable the background image during a remote session . otherwise the client decides whether the background will be enabled or disabled . 
network port
assign port automatically
check this option to assign the network port automatically . this is recommended unless your network setup requires you to use a fixed port , for example because of a firewall . 
enter the tcp port number here
use this field to set a static port number for the desktop sharing service . note that if the port is already in use the desktop sharing service will not be accessible until you free it . it is recommended to assign the port automatically unless you know what you are doing . most vnc clients use a display number instead of the actual port . this display number is the offset to port 5900 , so port 5901 has the display number 1 .

& name / address : 
name / address field here you can enter the host name or address . the host may be specified in a number of ways : single host this is the most common format . you may specify a host either by an abbreviated name recognized by the resolver , the fully qualified domain name , or an ip address . netgroups nis netgroups may be given as @ group . only the host part of each netgroup members is consider in checking for membership . empty host parts or those containing a single dash ( - ) are ignored . wildcards machine names may contain the wildcard characters * and ? . this can be used to make the exports file more compact ; for instance , * . cs . foo . edu matches all hosts in the domain cs . foo . edu . however , these wildcard characters do not match the dots in a domain name , so the above pattern does not include hosts such as a . b . cs . foo . edu . ip networks you can also export directories to all hosts on an ip ( sub - ) network simultaneously . this is done by specifying an ip address and netmask pair as address / netmask where the netmask can be specified in dotted - decimal format , or as a contiguous mask length ( for example , either ` / 255.255.252.0 ' or ` / 22 ' appended to the network base address result in identical subnetworks with 10 bits of host ) .

connection & name : 
type in a unique name for this connection
phone number : 
specifies the phone numbers to dial . you can supply multiple numbers here , simply click on " add " . you can arrange the order the numbers are tried by using the arrow buttons . when a number is busy or fails , kppp will try the next number and so on
authentication : 
script - based
pap
terminal - based
chap
pap / chap
specifies the method used to identify yourself to the ppp server . most universities still use terminal - or script - based authentication , while most isp use pap and / or chap . if unsure , contact your isp . if you can choose between pap and chap , choose chap , because it is much safer . if you do not know whether pap or chap is right , choose pap / chap . 
store & password
when this is turned on , your isp password will be saved in kppp ' s config file , so you do not need to type it in every time . warning : your password will be stored as plain text in the config file , which is readable only to you . make sure nobody gains access to this file !

customize & pppd arguments . . . 
here you can select commands to run at certain stages of the connection . the commands are run with your real user id , so you cannot run any commands here requiring root permissions ( unless , of course , you are root ) . be sure to supply the whole path to the program otherwise kppp might be unable to find it . 
& before connect : 
allows you to run a program before a connection is established . it is called immediately before dialing has begun . this might be useful , e . g . to stop hylafax blocking the modem . 
& upon connect : 
allows you to run a program after a connection is established . when your program is called , all preparations for an internet connection are finished . very useful for fetching mail and news
before & disconnect : 
allows you to run a program before a connection is closed . the connection will stay open until the program exits . 
upon disconnect : 
allows you to run a program after a connection has been closed . 
dynamic ip address
select this option when your computer gets an internet address ( ip ) every time a connection is made . almost every internet service provider uses this method , so this should be turned on . 
static ip address
select this option when your computer has a fixed internet address ( ip ) . most computers do not have one , so you should probably select dynamic ip addressing unless you know what you are doing . 
& ip address : 
if your computer has a permanent internet address , you must supply your ip address here . 
& subnet mask : 
if your computer has a static internet address , you must supply a network mask here . in almost all cases this netmask will be 255.255.255.0 , but your mileage may vary . if unsure , contact your internet service provider
& auto - configure hostname from this ip
whenever you connect , this reconfigures your hostname to match the ip address you got from the ppp server . this may be useful if you need to use a protocol which depends on this information , but it can also cause several problems . do not enable this unless you really need it . 
selecting this option might cause some weird problems with the x - server and applications while kppp is connected . do not use it unless you know what you are doing . for more information take a look at the handbook ( or help ) in the " frequently asked questions " section . 
domain & name : 
if you enter a domain name here , this domain name is used for your computer while you are connected . when the connection is closed , the original domain name of your computer is restored . if you leave this field blank , no changes are made to the domain name . 
configuration : 
dns & ip address : 
allows you to specify a new dns server to be used while you are connected . when the connection is closed , this dns entry will be removed again . to add a dns server , type in the ip address of the dns server here and click on add
click this button to add the dns server specified in the field above . the entry will then be added to the list below
click this button to remove the selected dns server entry from the list below
dns address & list : 
this shows all defined dns servers to use while you are connected . use the add and remove buttons to modify the list
& disable existing dns servers during connection
when this option is selected , all dns servers specified in / etc / resolv . conf are temporary disabled while the dialup connection is established . after the connection is closed , the servers will be re - enabled typically , there is no reason to use this option , but it may become useful under some circumstances . 
default gateway
this makes the ppp peer computer ( the computer you are connected to with your modem ) to act as a gateway . your computer will send all packets not going to a computer inside your local net to this computer , which will route these packets . this is the default for most isps , so you should probably leave this option on . 
static gateway
allows you to specify which computer you want to use as gateway ( see default gateway above ) 
gateway & ip address : 
& assign the default route to this gateway
if this option is enabled , all packets not going to the local net are routed through the ppp connection . normally , you should turn this on
add phone number
enter a phone number : 
pppd version : 
pppd & timeout : 
kppp will wait this number of seconds to see if a ppp connection is established . if no connection is made in this time frame , kppp will give up and kill pppd . 
dock into panel on connect
after a connection is established , the window is minimized and a small icon in the kde panel represents this window . clicking on this icon will restore the window to its original location and size . 
automatic redial on disconnect
when a connection is established and it somehow gets disconnected , kppp will try to reconnect to the same account . see here for more on this topic . 
automatic redial on no & carrier
when dialing if modem returns no carrier the program will make a new attempt to redial instead of waiting for user to click < cancel > button . 
& show clock on caption
when this option is checked , the window title shows the time since a connection was established . very useful , so you should turn this on
disconnect on x server shutdown
checking this option will close any open connection when the x - server is shut down . you should enable this option unless you know what you are doing . see here for more on this . 
& quit on disconnect
when this option is turned on , kppp will be closed when you disconnect
minimize window on connect
iconifies kppp ' s window when a connection is established
type in a unique name for this modem
modem device : 
this specifies the serial port your modem is attached to . on linux / x86 , typically this is either / dev / ttys0 ( com1 under dos ) or / dev / ttys1 ( com2 under dos ) . if you have an internal isdn card with at command emulation ( most cards under linux support this ) , you should select one of the / dev / ttyix devices . 
& flow control : 
software [ xon / xoff ] 
specifies how the serial port and modem communicate . you should not change this unless you know what you are doing . default : crtscts
& line termination : 
specifies how at commands are sent to your modem . most modems will work fine with the default cr / lf . if your modem does not react to the init string , you should try different settings here default : cr / lf
connection speed : 
specifies the speed your modem and the serial port talk to each other . you should begin with at least 115200 bits / sec ( or more if you know that your serial port supports higher speeds ) . if you have connection problems , try to reduce this value . 
& use lock file
to prevent other programs from accessing the modem while a connection is established , a file can be created to indicate that the modem is in use . on linux an example file would be / var / lock / lck . . ttys1 here you can select whether this locking will be done . default : on
modem & timeout : 
this specifies how long kppp waits for a connect response from your modem . the recommended value is 30 seconds . 
& wait for dial tone before dialing
normally the modem waits for a dial tone from your phone line , indicating that it can start to dial a number . if your modem does not recognize this sound , or your local phone system does not emit such a tone , uncheck this option default : : on
busy wait : 
specifies the number of seconds to wait before redial if all dialed numbers are busy . this is necessary because some modems get stuck if the same number is busy too often . the default is 0 seconds , you should not change this unless you need to . 
modem & volume : 
most modems have a speaker which makes a lot of noise when dialing . here you can either turn this completely off or select a lower volume . if this does not work for your modem , you must modify the modem volume command . 
modem asserts cd line
this controls how kppp detects that the modem is not responding . unless you are having problems with this , do not modify this setting . default : off
modem commands . . . 
allows you to change the at command for your modem . 
& query modem . . . 
most modems support the ati command set to find out vendor and revision of your modem . press this button to query your modem for this information . it can be useful to help you set up the modem

these certificates will be deleted even though you did not explicitly select them ( why ? ) : 
why do you want to delete more certificates than i selected ? when you delete ca certificates ( both root cas and intermediate cas ) , the certificates issued by them will also be deleted . this can be nicely seen in kleopatra ' s hierarchical view mode : in this mode , if you delete a certificate that has children , those children will also be deleted . think of ca certificates as folders containing other certificates : when you delete the folder , you delete its contents , too .

message part properties
the mime type of the file : normally , you do not need to touch this setting , since the type of the file is automatically checked ; but , sometimes , % 1 may not detect the type correctly - - here is where you can fix that . 
the size of the part : sometimes , % 1 will only give an estimated size here , because calculating the exact size would take too much time ; when this is the case , it will be made visible by adding " ( est . ) " to the size displayed . 
the file name of the part : although this defaults to the name of the attached file , it does not specify the file to be attached ; rather , it suggests a file name to be used by the recipient ' s mail agent when saving the part to disk . 
a description of the part : this is just an informational description of the part , much like the subject is for the whole message ; most mail agents will show this information in their message previews alongside the attachment ' s icon . 
the transport encoding of this part : normally , you do not need to change this , since % 1 will use a decent default encoding , depending on the mime type ; yet , sometimes , you can significantly reduce the size of the resulting message , e . g . if a postscript file does not contain binary data , but consists of pure text - - in this case , choosing " quoted - printable " over the default " base64 " will save up to 25 % in resulting message size . 
suggest & automatic display
check this option if you want to suggest to the recipient the automatic ( inline ) display of this part in the message preview , instead of the default icon view ; technically , this is carried out by setting this part ' s content - disposition header field to " inline " instead of the default " attachment " . 
& sign this part
check this option if you want this message part to be signed ; the signature will be made with the key that you associated with the currently - selected identity . 
encrypt this part
check this option if you want this message part to be encrypted ; the part will be encrypted for the recipients of this message

& automatically sign messages
when this option is enabled , all messages you send will be signed by default ; of course , it is still possible to disable signing for each message individually . 
encrypting
when this option is enabled , the message / file will not only be encrypted with the receiver ' s public key , but also with your key . this will enable you to decrypt the message / file at a later time . this is generally a good idea . 
show signed / encrypted text after composing
when this option is enabled , the signed / encrypted text will be shown in a separate window , enabling you to know how it will look before it is sent . this is a good idea when you are verifying that your encryption system works . 
store sent messages encrypted
check to store messages encrypted
store messages encrypted when this box is checked , sent messages are stored encrypted like they were sent . this is not recommended , as you will not be able to read the messages any longer if a necessary certificate expires . however , there may be local rules that require you to turn this option on . when in doubt , check with your local administrator . 
always show the encryption keys & for approval
when this option is enabled , the application will always show you a list of public keys from which you can choose the one it will use for encryption . if it is off , the application will only show the dialog if it cannot find the right key or if there are several which could be used . 
automatically encrypt & messages whenever possible
when this option is enabled , every message you send will be encrypted whenever encryption is possible and desired ; of course , it is still possible to disable the automatic encryption for each message individually .

html messages
warning : allowing html in email may increase the risk that your system will be compromised by present and anticipated security exploits . more about html mails . . . more about external references . . . 
messages sometimes come in both formats . this option controls whether you want the html part or the plain text part to be displayed . displaying the html part makes the message look better , but at the same time increases the risk of security holes being exploited . displaying the plain text part loses much of the message ' s formatting , but makes it almost impossible to exploit security holes in the html renderer ( konqueror ) . the option below guards against one common misuse of html messages , but it cannot guard against security issues that were not known at the time this version of kmail was written . it is therefore advisable to not prefer html to plain text . note : you can set this option on a per - folder basis from the folder menu of kmail ' s main window . 
prefer html to plain text
some mail advertisements are in html and contain references to , for example , images that the advertisers employ to find out that you have read their message ( " web bugs " ) . there is no valid reason to load images off the internet like this , since the sender can always attach the required images directly to the message . to guard from such a misuse of the html displaying feature of kmail , this option is disabled by default . however , if you wish to , for example , view images in html messages that were not attached to it , you can enable this option , but you should be aware of the possible problem .

message disposition notifications
send policy : 
message disposition notification policy mdns are a generalization of what is commonly called read receipt . the message author requests a disposition notification to be sent and the receiver ' s mail program generates a reply from which the author can learn what happened to his message . common disposition types include displayed ( i . e . read ) , deleted and dispatched ( e . g . forwarded ) . the following options are available to control kmail ' s sending of mdns : ignore : ignores any request for disposition notifications . no mdn will ever be sent automatically ( recommended ) . ask : answers requests only after asking the user for permission . this way , you can send mdns for selected messages while denying or ignoring them for others . deny : always sends a denied notification . this is only slightly better than always sending mdns . the author will still know that the messages has been acted upon , he just cannot tell whether it was deleted or read etc . always send : always sends the requested disposition notification . that means that the author of the message gets to know when the message was acted upon and , in addition , what happened to it ( displayed , deleted , etc . ) . this option is strongly discouraged , but since it makes much sense e . g . for customer relationship management , it has been made available .

here you can get some assistance in setting up kmail ' s filter rules to use some commonly - known anti - virus tools . the wizard can detect those tools on your computer as well as create filter rules to classify messages using these tools and to separate messages containing viruses . the wizard will not take any existing filter rules into consideration : it will always append the new rules . warning : as kmail appears to be frozen during the scan of the messages for viruses , you may encounter problems with the responsiveness of kmail because anti - virus tool operations are usually time consuming ; please consider deleting the filter rules created by the wizard to get back to the former behavior . 
& mark detected spam messages as read
mark messages which have been classified as spam as read . 
check messages using the anti - virus tools
let the anti - virus tools check your messages . the wizard will create appropriate filters . the messages are usually marked by the tools so that following filters can react on this and , for example , move virus messages to a special folder . 
move detected viral messages to the selected folder
a filter to detect messages classified as virus - infected and to move those messages into a predefined folder is created . the default folder is the trash folder , but you may change that in the folder view . 
additionally , mark detected viral messages as read

you can download new or updated syntax highlight definitions from the highlighting page in the configuration dialog . just click the download . . . button on the open / save - gt ; modes & filetypes tab ( you have to be online , of course . . . ) . 
you can cycle through all open documents by pressing alt + left or alt + right . the next / previous document will immediately be displayed in the active frame . 
you can do cool sed - like regular expression replacements using command line . for example , press f7 and enter s / oldtext / newtext / g to replace & quot ; oldtextquot ; with & quot ; newtextquot ; throughout the current line . 
you can repeat your last search by just pressing f3 , or shift + f3 if you want to search backwards . 
you can filter the files displayed in the file selector tool view . simply enter your filter in the filter entry at the bottom , for example : * . html * . php if you only want to see html and php files in the current folder . the file selector will even remember your filters for you . < strong > 
you can have two views - or even more - of the same document in kate . editing in either will be reflected in both . so if you find yourself scrolling up and down to look at text at the other end of a document , just press ctrl + shift + t to split horizontally . 
press f8 or shift + f8 to switch to the next / previous frame .

parts overview
top cost call stack
the top cost call stack this is a purely fictional ' most probable ' call stack . it is built up by starting with the current selected function and adds the callers / callees with highest cost at the top and to bottom . the cost and calls columns show the cost used for all calls from the function in the line above . 
flat profile
profile dumps this dockable shows in the top part the list of loadable profile dumps in all subdirectories of : current working directory of kcachegrind , i . e . where it was started from , and the default profile dump directory given in the configuration . the list is sorted according to the target command profiled in the corresponding dump . on selecting a profile dump , information for it is shown in the bottom area of the dockable : options allows you to view the profiled command and profile options of this dump . by changing any item , a new ( yet unexisting ) profile template is created . press run profile to start a profile run with these options in the background . info gives detailed info on the selected dump like event cost summary and properties of the simulated cache . state is only available for current happening profiles runs . press update to see different counters of the run , and a stack trace of the current position in the program profiled . check the every option to let kcachegrind regularly poll these data . check the sync option to let the dockable activate the top function in the current loaded dump .

new open new empty kcachegrind window . 
add profile data this opens an additional profile data file in the current window . 
reload profile data this loads any new created parts , too . 
& export graph
export call graph generates a file with extension . dot for the tools of the graphviz package . 
& force dump
force dump this forces a dump for a callgrind profile run in the current directory . this action is checked while kcachegrind looks for the dump . if the dump is finished , it automatically reloads the current trace . if this is the one from the running callgrind , the new created trace part will be loaded , too . force dump creates a file ' callgrind . cmd ' , and checks every second for its existence . a running callgrind will detect this file , dump a trace part , and delete ' callgrind . cmd ' . the deletion is detected by kcachegrind , and it does a reload . if there is no callgrind running , press ' force dump ' again to cancel the dump request . this deletes ' callgrind . cmd ' itself and stops polling for a new dump . note : a callgrind run only detects existence of ' callgrind . cmd ' when actively running a few milliseconds , i . e . not sleeping . tip : for a profiled gui program , you can awake callgrind e . g . by resizing a window of the program .

show relative instead of absolute costs
relative to parent
show percentage costs relative to parent
show percentage costs relative to parent if this is switched off , percentage costs are always shown relative to the total cost of the profile part ( s ) that are currently browsed . by turning on this option , percentage cost of shown cost items will be relative to the parent cost item . cost type parent cost function cumulative total function self function group ( * ) / total call function inclusive source line function inclusive ( * ) only if function grouping is switched on ( e . g . elf object grouping ) . 
cycle detection
detect recursive cycles if this is switched off , the treemap drawing will show black areas when a recursive call is made instead of drawing the recursion ad infinitum . note that the size of black areas often will be wrong , as inside recursive cycles the cost of calls cannot be determined ; the error is small , however , for false cycles ( see documentation ) . the correct handling for cycles is to detect them and collapse all functions of a cycle into an artificial function , which is done when this option is selected . unfortunately , with gui applications , this often will lead to huge false cycles , making the analysis impossible ; therefore , there is the option to switch this off .

. . . that the what ' s this . . . help for every gui widget in kcachegrind contains detailed usage information for this widget ? it is highly recommend to read at least these help texts on first use . request what ' s this . . . help by pressing shift - f1 and clicking on the widget . 
. . . that you can get profile information at instruction level with calltree when you provide the option - - dump - instr = yes ? use the assembler view for the instruction annotations . 
. . . that you can use alt - left / right keys of your keyboard to go back / forward in the active object history ? 
. . . that you can navigate in the callee / caller map view using arrow keys ? use left / right to change to siblings of the current item ; use up / down to go one nesting level up / down . to select the current item , press space , and to activate it , press return . 
. . . that you can navigate in the call graph view using arrow keys ? use up / down to go one calling level up / down , alternating between calls and functions . use left / right to change to siblings of a current selected call . to activate the current item , press return . 
. . . that you can rapidly locate a function by entering part of its name ( case - insensitive ) into the edit line of the toolbar and hit return ? 
. . . that you can assign custom colors to elf objects / c + + classes / source files for graph coloring in settings - > configure kcachegrind . . . ? 
. . . that you can see if debug info is available for a selected function by looking at the location label in the info tab or the source listing header in the source tab ? there must be the name of the source file ( with extension ) . if kcachegrind still does not show the source , make sure that you have added the directory of the source file to the source directories list in the configuration . 
. . . that you can configure whether kcachgrind should show absolute event counts or relative ones ( percentage display ) ? 
. . . that you can configure the maximum number of items for all function lists in kcachegrind ? limiting the number of items is done to get a fast reacting gui . the last item in the list will show you the number of skipped functions , together with a cost condition for these skipped functions . to activate a function with small costs , search for it and select it in the flat profile . selecting functions with small cost will temporarily add them to the flat profile list . 
. . . that the coverage tab - in contrast to the call lists tab - shows all functions that are calling the selected function ( upper part ) / are called by the selected function ( bottom part ) , no matter how many function are between them on the stack ? examples : an entry in the upper list for function foo1 ( ) with a value of 50 % with function bar ( ) selected means that 50 % of all the cost of function bar ( ) happened while called from function foo1 ( ) . an entry in the bottom list for function foo2 ( ) with a value of 50 % with function bar ( ) selected means that 50 % of all the cost of function bar ( ) happened while calling foo2 ( ) from bar ( ) . 
. . . that waiting for the tool tip inside of a tree map shows the list of names of the nested rectangles the mouse pointer is over ? items from this list can be selected by pressing the right mouse button . 
. . . that you can constrain the cost counts shown to only a few parts of the whole trace by selecting these parts in the " trace selection " dockable ? to generate multiple parts in a profiling run with cachegrind , use e . g . option - - cachedumps = xxx for parts of a length of xxx basic blocks ( a basic block is a run of not - branching assembler statements inside of your program code ) .

the parts overview a trace consists of multiple trace parts when there are several profile data files from one profile run . the trace part overview dockable shows these , horizontally ordered in execution time ; the rectangle sizes are proportional to the total cost spent in the parts . you can select one or several parts to constrain all costs shown to these parts only . the parts are further subdivided : there is a partitioning and an callee split mode : partitioning : you see the partitioning into groups for a trace part , according to the group type selected . e . g . if elf object groups are selected , you see colored rectangles for each used elf object ( shared library or executable ) , sized according to the cost spent therein . callee : a rectangle showing the inclusive cost of the current selected function in the trace part is shown . this is split up into smaller rectangles to show the costs of its callees . 
the flat profile the flat profile contains a group and a function selection list . the group list contains all groups where costs are spent in , depending on the chosen group type . the group list is hidden when group type ' function ' is selected . the function list contains the functions of the selected group ( or all for ' function ' group type ) , ordered by the costs spent therein . functions with costs less than 1 % are hidden on default .

annotated assembler the annotated assembler list shows the machine code instructions of the current selected function together with ( self ) cost spent while executing an instruction . if this is a call instruction , lines with details on the call happening are inserted into the source : the cost spent inside of the call , the number of calls happening , and the call destination . the disassembler output shown is generated with the ' objdump ' utility from the ' binutils ' package . select a line with call information to make the destination function of this call current .

call graph around active function depending on configuration , this view shows the call graph environment of the active function . note : the shown cost is only the cost which is spent while the active function was actually running ; i . e . the cost shown for main ( ) - if it is visible - should be the same as the cost of the active function , as that is the part of inclusive cost of main ( ) spent while the active function was running . for cycles , blue call arrows indicate that this is an artificial call added for correct drawing which actually never happened . if the graph is larger than the widget area , an overview panner is shown in one edge . there are similar visualization options to the call treemap ; the selected function is highlighted .

call map this graph shows the nested hierarchy of all callees of the current activated function . each colored rectangle represents a function ; its size tries to be proportional to the cost spent therein while the active function is running ( however , there are drawing constrains ) . 
appearance options can be found in the in the context menu . to get exact size proportions , choose ' hide incorrect borders ' . as this mode can be very time consuming , you may want to limit the maximum drawn nesting level before . ' best ' determinates the split direction for children from the aspect ratio of the parent . ' always best ' decides on remaining space for each sibling . ' ignore proportions ' takes space for function name drawing before drawing children . note that size proportions can get heavily wrong . this is a treemap widget . keyboard navigation is available with the left / right arrow keys for traversing siblings , and up / down arrow keys to go a nesting level up / down . return activates the current item .

this will compare url1 with url2
this will open url1 and expect it to be diff output . url1 can also be a ' - ' and then it will read from standard input . can be used for instance for cvs diff _ bar _ kompare - o - . kompare will do a check to see if it can find the original file ( s ) and then blend the original file ( s ) into the diffoutput and show that in the viewer . - n disables the check . 
this will blend url2 into url1 , url2 is expected to be diff output and url1 the file or folder that the diffoutput needs to be blended into . 
disables the check for automatically finding the original file ( s ) when using ' - ' as url with the - o option . 
use this to specify the encoding when calling it from the command line . it will default to the local encoding if not specified .

name ( minimum 5 characters ) : 
custom decryption command : this option allows the user to specify a custom command to be executed by gpg when decryption occurs . ( this is recommended for advanced users only ) . 
custom decryption command : 
pgp 6 compatibility
pgp 6 compatibility : checking this option forces gnupg to output encrypted packets that are as compliant with pgp ( pretty good privacy ) 6 standards as possible thus allowing gnupg users to inter operate with pgp 6 users . 
ascii armored encryption
ascii armored encryption : checking this option outputs all encrypted files in a format that can be opened by a text editor and as such the output is suitable for placing in the body of an e - mail message . 
use * . pgp extension for encrypted files
use * . pgp extension for encrypted files : checking this option will append a . pgp extension to all encrypted files instead of a . gpg extension . this option will maintain compatibility with users of pgp ( pretty good privacy ) software . 
hide user id
hide user id : checking this option will remove the keyid of the recipient from all encrypted packets . the advantage : traffic analysis of the encrypted packets cannot be performed as easily because the recipient is unknown . the disadvantage : the receiver of the encrypted packets is forced to try all secret keys before being able to decrypt the packets . this can be a lengthy process depending on the number of secret keys the receiver holds . 
custom encryption command : 
custom encryption command : when activated , an entry field will be shown in the key selection dialog , enabling you to enter a custom command for encryption . this option is recommended for experienced users only . 
always encrypt with : 
always encrypt with : this ensures all files / messages will also be encrypted with the chosen key . however , if the " encrypt files with : " option is selected that chosen key will override the " always encrypt with : " selection . 
encrypt files with : 
encrypt files with : checking this option and selecting a key will force any file encryption operation to use the selected key . kgpg will not query for a recipient and the default key will be bypassed . 
allow encryption with untrusted keys
allow encryption with untrusted keys : when importing a public key , the key is usually marked as untrusted and as such cannot be used unless it is signed by the default key ( thus making it ' trusted ' ) . checking this box enables any key to be used even if it is untrusted .

key server : a key server is a centralized repository of pgp / gnupg keys connected to the internet which can be conveniently accessed in order to obtain or deposit keys . select from the drop down list to specify which key server should be used . often these keys are held by people whom the user has never met and as such the authenticity is dubious at best . refer to the gnupg manual covering " web - of - trust " relationships to find out how gnupg works around the problem of verifying authenticity . 
key server drop down dialog : allows the user to select the key server which will be used to import pgp / gnupg keys into the local keyring . 
text to search or id of the key to import : there are multiple ways to search for a key , you can use a text or partial text search ( example : entering phil or zimmerman will bring up all keys in which phil or zimmerman shows up ) or you can search by the id ' s of the key . key id ' s are strings of letters and numbers that uniquely identify a key ( example : searching for 0xed7585f4 would bring up the key associated with that id ) .

if you want to decrypt a text file , simply drag and drop it into the editor window . kgpg will do the rest . even remote files can be dropped . drag a public key into the editor window and kgpg will automatically import it if you want . 
the easiest way to encrypt a file : simply right click on the file , and you have an encrypt option in the contextual menu . this works in konqueror or on your desktop ! 
if you want to encrypt a message for several persons , just select several encryption keys by pressing the & quot ; ctrlquot ; key . 
you do not know anything about encryption ? no problem , simply create yourself a key pair in the key management window . then , export your public key and mail it to your friends . ask them to do the same and import their public keys . finally , to send an encrypted message , type it in the kgpg editor , then click & quot ; encryptquot ; . choose your friend key and click & quot ; encryptquot ; again . the message will be encrypted , ready to be sent by email . 
to perform an operation on a key , open the key management window and right click on the key . a popup menu with all available options will appear . 
decrypt a file with a single mouse click on it . you will then be prompted for password , and then that is it !

simple autocorrection
detect when a new sentence is started and always ensure that the first character is an uppercase character
convert & first letter of a sentence automatically to uppercase ( e . g . " my house . in this town " to " my house . in this town " ) 
all words are checked for the common mistake of holding the shift key down a bit too long . if some words must have two uppercase characters , then those exceptions should be added in the ' exceptions ' tab . 
convert & two uppercase characters to one uppercase and one lowercase character ( e . g . perfect to perfect ) 
detect when a url ( uniform resource locator ) is typed and provide formatting that matches the way an internet browser would show a url . 
autoformat & urls
make sure that more than one space cannot be typed , as this is a common mistake which is quite hard to find in formatted text . 
& suppress double spaces
keep correct formatting and indenting of sentences by automatically removing spaces typed at the beginning and end of a paragraph . 
remove spaces at the beginning and end of paragraphs
when you use _ underline _ or * bold * , the text between the underscores or asterisks will be converted to underlined or bold text . 
automatically do & bold and underline formatting
most standard fraction notations will be converted when available
replace 1/2 . . . with ½ . . . 
when typing ' 1 ) ' or similar in front of a paragraph , automatically convert the paragraph to use that numbering style . this has the advantage that further paragraphs will also be numbered and the spacing is done correctly . 
use & autonumbering for numbered paragraphs
replace 1st . . . with 1 ^ st . . . 
capitalize name of days
when typing ' * ' or ' - ' in front of a paragraph , automatically convert the paragraph to use that list - style . using a list - style formatting means that a correct bullet is used to draw the list .

the document will be able to be compiled alone
the document will be generated as a full latex document since all the include will be generated before the \\begin [ document } and \\end { document } commands . 
document to include
do not generate either the latex header or the document environment
the document will be generated as a latex document which will have to be included in a main latex document . it will allow you to generate several little files for each chapter of your document . 
default font size :

most write documents are stored using this encoding ( also known as windows - 1252 ) . select this if unsure . 
these advanced options allow you to fine - tune the importing of formatting information . they compensate for differences between kword and ms write by adding extra formatting information ( not found in the original document ) , to try to make the imported document look as close to the original as possible . it is safe to use the defaults , if unsure .

linear ( 2,4,6 , . . . ) 
generate a series from ' start ' to ' end ' and for each step add the value provided in step . this creates a series where each value is ' step ' larger than the value before it . 
geometric ( 2,4,8 , . . . ) 
generate a series from ' start ' to ' end ' and for each step multiply the value with the value provided in step . using a step of 5 produces a list like : 5,25,125,625 since 5 multiplied by 5 ( step ) equals 25 , and that multiplied by 5 equals 125 , which multiplied by the same step - value of 5 equals 625 .

user ( user ) the user the server runs under . normally this must be lp , however you can configure things for another user as needed . note : the server must be run initially as root to support the default ipp port of 631 . it changes users whenever an external program is run . . . ex : lp
group ( group ) the group the server runs under . normally this must be sys , however you can configure things for another group as needed . ex : sys
rip cache ( ripcache ) the amount of memory that each rip should use to cache bitmaps . the value can be any real number followed by " k " for kilobytes , " m " for megabytes , " g " for gigabytes , or " t " for tiles ( 1 tile = 256x256 pixels ) . defaults to " 8m " ( 8 megabytes ) . ex : 8m
temporary files ( tempdir ) the directory to put temporary files in . this directory must be writable by the user defined above ! defaults to " / var / spool / cups / tmp " or the value of the tmpdir environment variable . ex : / var / spool / cups / tmp
filter limit ( filterlimit ) sets the maximum cost of all job filters that can be run at the same time . a limit of 0 means no limit . a typical job may need a filter limit of at least 200 ; limits less than the minimum required by a job force a single job to be printed at any time . the default limit is 0 ( unlimited ) . ex : 200
listen to ( port / listen ) ports / addresses that are listened to . the default port 631 is reserved for the internet printing protocol ( ipp ) and is what is used here . you can have multiple port / listen lines to listen to more than one port or address , or to restrict access . note : unfortunately , most web browsers do n ' t support tls or http upgrades for encryption . if you want to support web - based encryption you will probably need to listen on port 443 ( the " https " port . . . ) . ex : 631 , myhost : 80,1.2.3.4:631
hostname lookups ( hostnamelookups ) whether or not to do lookups on ip addresses to get a fully - qualified hostname . this defaults to off for performance reasons . . . ex : on

client timeout ( timeout ) the timeout ( in seconds ) before requests time out . default is 300 seconds . ex : 300
use browsing ( browsing ) whether or not to listen to printer information from other cups servers . enabled by default . note : to enable the sending of browsing information from this cups server to the lan , specify a valid browseaddress . ex : on
use short names ( browseshortnames ) whether or not to use " short " names for remote printers when possible ( e . g . " printer " instead of " printer @ host " ) . enabled by default . ex : yes
browse addresses ( browseaddress ) specifies a broadcast address to be used . by default browsing information is broadcast to all active interfaces . note : hp - ux 10.20 and earlier do not properly handle broadcast unless you have a class a , b , c , or d netmask ( i . e . no cidr support ) . ex : x . y . z . 255 , x . y . 255.255
browse allow / deny ( browseallow / browsedeny ) browseallow : specifies an address mask to allow for incoming browser packets . the default is to allow packets from all addresses . browsedeny : specifies an address mask to deny for incoming browser packets . the default is to deny packets from no addresses . both " browseallow " and " browsedeny " accept the following notations for addresses : all none * . domain . com . domain . com host . domain . com nnn . * nnn . nnn . * nnn . nnn . nnn . * nnn . nnn . nnn . nnn nnn . nnn . nnn . nnn / mm nnn . nnn . nnn . nnn / mmm . mmm . mmm . mmm the hostname / domainname restrictions only work if you have turned hostname lookups on ! 
browse interval ( browseinterval ) the time between browsing updates in seconds . default is 30 seconds . note that browsing information is sent whenever a printer ' s state changes as well , so this represents the maximum time between updates . set this to 0 to disable outgoing broadcasts so your local printers are not advertised but you can still see printers on other hosts . ex : 30
browse order ( browseorder ) specifies the order of browseallow / browsedeny comparisons . ex : allow , deny
browse poll ( browsepoll ) poll the named server ( s ) for printers . ex : myhost : 631
browse port ( browseport ) the port used for udp broadcasts . by default this is the ipp port ; if you change this you need to do it on all servers . only one browseport is recognized . ex : 631
browse relay ( browserelay ) relay browser packets from one address / network to another . ex : src - address dest - address
browse timeout ( browsetimeout ) the timeout ( in seconds ) for network printers - if we do n ' t get an update within this time the printer will be removed from the printer list . this number definitely should not be less the browseinterval value for obvious reasons . defaults to 300 seconds . ex : 300
implicit classes ( implicitclasses ) whether or not to use implicit classes . printer classes can be specified explicitly in the classes . conf file , implicitly based upon the printers available on the lan , or both . when implicitclasses is on , printers on the lan with the same name ( e . g . acme - laserprint - 1000 ) will be put into a class with the same name . this allows you to setup multiple redundant queues on a lan without a lot of administrative difficulties . if a user sends a job to acme - laserprint - 1000 , the job will go to the first available queue . enabled by default . 
system group ( systemgroup ) the group name for " system " ( printer administration ) access . the default varies depending on the operating system , but will be sys , system , or root ( checked for in that order ) . ex : sys

authentication ( authtype ) the authorization to use : none - perform no authentication . basic - perform authentication using the http basic method . digest - perform authentication using the http digest method . note : local certificate authentication can be substituted by the client for basic or digest when connecting to the localhost interface . 
class ( authclass ) the authorization class ; currently only anonymous , user , system ( valid user belonging to group systemgroup ) , and group ( valid user belonging to the specified group ) are supported . 
the user / group names allowed to access the resource . the format is a comma separated list . 
satisfy ( satisfy ) this directive controls whether all specified conditions must be satisfied to allow access to the resource . if set to " all " , then all authentication and access control conditions must be satisfied to allow access . setting satisfy to " any " allows a user to gain access if the authentication or access control requirements are satisfied . for example , you might require authentication for remote access , but allow local access without authentication . the default is " all " . 
authentication group name ( authgroupname ) the group name for group authorization . 
acl order ( order ) the order of allow / deny processing . 
allow allows access from the specified hostname , domain , ip address , or network . possible values are : all none * . domain . com . domain . com host . domain . com nnn . * nnn . nnn . * nnn . nnn . nnn . * nnn . nnn . nnn . nnn nnn . nnn . nnn . nnn / mm nnn . nnn . nnn . nnn / mmm . mmm . mmm . mmm the host and domain address require that you enable hostname lookups with " hostnamelookups on " above . 
acl addresses ( allow / deny ) allows / denies access from the specified hostname , domain , ip address , or network . possible values are : all none * . domain . com . domain . com host . domain . com nnn . * nnn . nnn . * nnn . nnn . nnn . * nnn . nnn . nnn . nnn nnn . nnn . nnn . nnn / mm nnn . nnn . nnn . nnn / mmm . mmm . mmm . mmm the host and domain address require that you enable hostname lookups with " hostnamelookups on " above . 
encryption ( encryption ) whether or not to use encryption ; this depends on having the openssl library linked into the cups library and scheduler . possible values : always - always use encryption ( ssl ) never - never use encryption required - use tls encryption upgrade ifrequested - use encryption if the server requests it the default value is " ifrequested " .

browse protocols ( browseprotocols ) which protocols to use for browsing . can be any of the following separated by whitespace and / or commas : all - use all supported protocols . cups - use the cups browse protocol . slp - use the slpv2 protocol . the default is cups . note : if you choose to use slpv2 , it is strongly recommended that you have at least one slp directory agent ( da ) on your network . otherwise , browse updates can take several seconds , during which the scheduler will not response to client requests . 
classification ( classification ) the classification level of the server . if set , this classification is displayed on all pages , and raw printing is disabled . the default is the empty string . ex : confidential
allow overrides ( classifyoverride ) whether to allow users to override the classification on printouts . if enabled , users can limit banner pages to before or after the job , and can change the classification of a job , but cannot completely eliminate the classification or banners . the default is off . 
hide implicit members ( hideimplicitmembers ) whether or not to show the members of an implicit class . when hideimplicitmembers is on , any remote printers that are part of an implicit class are hidden from the user , who will then only see a single queue even though many queues will be supporting the implicit class . enabled by default . 
use & quot ; anyquot ; classes ( implicitanyclasses ) whether or not to create anyprinter implicit classes . when implicitanyclasses is on and a local queue of the same name exists , e . g . " printer " , " printer @ server1 " , " printer @ server1 " , then an implicit class called " anyprinter " is created instead . when implicitanyclasses is off , implicit classes are not created when there is a local queue of the same name . disabled by default . 
max jobs ( maxjobs ) maximum number of jobs to keep in memory ( active and completed ) . default is 0 ( no limit ) . 
max jobs per user ( maxjobsperuser ) the maxjobsperuser directive controls the maximum number of active jobs that are allowed for each user . once a user reaches the limit , new jobs will be rejected until one of the active jobs is completed , stopped , aborted , or canceled . setting the maximum to 0 disables this functionality . default is 0 ( no limit ) . 
max jobs per printer ( maxjobsperprinter ) the maxjobsperprinter directive controls the maximum number of active jobs that are allowed for each printer or class . once a printer or class reaches the limit , new jobs will be rejected until one of the active jobs is completed , stopped , aborted , or canceled . setting the maximum to 0 disables this functionality . default is 0 ( no limit ) . 
port the port value that the cups daemon is listening to . default is 631 . 
address the address that the cups daemon is listening at . leave it empty or use an asterisk ( * ) to specify a port value on the entire subnetwork . 
check this box if you want to use ssl encryption with this address / port .

kde printing management
( c ) 2000 - 2002 michael goffioul
michael goffioul
printers the kde printing manager is part of kdeprint which is the interface to the real print subsystem of your operating system ( os ) . although it does add some additional functionality of its own to those subsystems , kdeprint depends on them for its functionality . spooling and filtering tasks , especially , are still done by your print subsystem , or the administrative tasks ( adding or modifying printers , setting access rights , etc . ) what print features kdeprint supports is therefore heavily dependent on your chosen print subsystem . for the best support in modern printing , the kde printing team recommends a cups based printing system .

printer location : the location may describe where the selected printer is located . the location description is created by the administrator of the print system ( or may be left empty ) . 
printer type : the type indicates your printer type . 
printer state : the state indicates the state of the print queue on the print server ( which could be your localhost ) . the state may be ' idle ' , ' processing ' , ' stopped ' , ' paused ' or similar . 
printer comment : the comment may describe the selected printer . this comment is created by the administrator of the print system ( or may be left empty ) . 
printer selection menu : use this combo box to select the printer to which you want to print . initially ( if you run kdeprint for the first time ) , you may only find the kde special printers ( which save jobs to disk [ as postscript - or pdf - files ] , or deliver jobs via email ( as a pdf attachment ) . if you are missing a real printer , you need to . . . . . . either create a local printer with the help of the kde add printer wizard . the wizard is available for the cups and rlpr printing systems ( click button to the left of the ' properties ' button ) , . . . or try to connect to an existing remote cups print server . you can connect by clicking the ' system options ' button below . a new dialog opens : click on the ' cups server ' icon : fill in the information required to use the remote server . note : it may happen that you successfully connected to a remote cups server and still do not get a printer list . if this happens : force kdeprint to re - load its configuration files . to reload the configuration files , either start kprinter again , or switch the print system away from cups and back again once . the print system switch can be made through a selection in the drop - down menu at bottom of this dialog when fully expanded ) . 
print job properties : this button opens a dialog where you can make decisions regarding all supported print job options . 
selective view on list of printers : this button reduces the list of visible printers to a shorter , more convenient , pre - defined list . this is particularly useful in enterprise environments with lots of printers . the default is to show all printers . to create a personal ' selective view list ' , click on the ' system options ' button at the bottom of this dialog . then , in the new dialog , select ' filter ' ( left column in the kde print configuration dialog ) and setup your selection . warning : clicking this button without prior creation of a personal ' selective view list ' will make all printers dissappear from the view . ( to re - enable all printers , just click this button again . ) 
external print command here you can enter any command that would also print for you in a konsole window . example : a2ps - p & lt ; printernamegt ; - - medium = a3 . 
additional print job options this button shows or hides additional printing options . 
system options : this button starts a new dialog where you can adjust various settings of your printing system . amongst them : should kde applications embed all fonts into the postscript they generate for printing ? should kde use an external postscript viewer like gv for print page previews ? should kdeprint use a local or a remote cups server ? , and many more . . . . 
help : this button takes you to the complete kdeprint manual . 
cancel : this button cancels your print job and quits the kprinter dialog . 
print : this button sends the job to the printing process . if you are sending non - postscript files , you may be asked if you want kde to convert the files into postscript , or if you want your print subsystem ( like cups ) to do this . 
keep printing dialog open if you enable this checkbox , the printing dialog stays open after you hit the print button . this is especially useful , if you need to test various print settings ( like color matching for an inkjet printer ) or if you want to send your job to multiple printers ( one after the other ) to have it finished more quickly . 
output file name and path : the " output file : " shows you where your file will be saved if you decide to " print to file " your job , using one of the kde special printers named " print to file ( postscript ) " or " print to file ( pdf ) " . choose a name and location that suits your need by using the button and / or editing the line on the right . 
output file name and path : edit this line to create a path and filename that suits your needs . ( button and lineedit field are only available if you " print to file " ) 
browse directories button : this button calls the " file open / browse directories " dialog to let you choose a directory and file name where your " print - to - file " job should be saved . 
add file to job this button calls the " file open / browse directories " dialog to allow you to select a file for printing . note , that you can select ascii or international text , pdf , postscript , jpeg , tiff , png , gif and many other graphical formats . you can select various files from different paths and send them as one " multi - file job " to the printing system . 
print preview enable this checkbox if you want to see a preview of your printout . a preview lets you check if , for instance , your intended " poster " or " pamphlet " layout looks like you expected , without wasting paper first . it also lets you cancel the job if something looks wrong . note : the preview feature ( and therefore this checkbox ) is only visible for printjobs created from inside kde applications . if you start kprinter from the commandline , or if you use kprinter as a print command for non - kde applications ( like acrobat reader , firefox or openoffice ) , print preview is not available here . 
set as default printer this button sets the current printer as the user ' s default . note : ( button is only visible if the checkbox for system options - - > general - - > miscellaneous : " defaults to the last printer used in the application " is disabled . )

print job billing and accounting insert a meaningful string here to associate the current print job with a certain account . this string will appear in the cups " page _ log " to help with the print accounting in your organization . ( leave it empty if you do not need it . ) it is useful for people who print on behalf of different " customers " , like print service bureaux , letter shops , press and prepress companies , or secretaries who serve different bosses , etc . additional hint for power users : this kdeprint gui element corresponds to the cups command line job option parameter : - o job - billing = . . . # example : " marketing _ department " or " joe _ doe " 
scheduled printing scheduled printing lets you control the time of the actual printout , while you can still send away your job now and have it out of your way . especially useful is the " never ( hold indefinitely ) " option . it allows you to park your job until a time when you ( or a printer administrator ) decides to manually release it . this is often required in enterprise environments , where you normally are not allowed to directly and immediately access the huge production printers in your central repro department . however it is okay to send jobs to the queue which is under the control of the operators ( who , after all , need to make sure that the 10,000 sheets of pink paper which is required by the marketing department for a particular job are available and loaded into the paper trays . ) additional hint for power users : this kdeprint gui element corresponds to the cups command line job option parameter : - o job - hold - until = . . . # example : " indefinite " or " no - hold " 
page labels page labels are printed by cups at the top and bottom of each page . they appear on the pages surrounded by a little frame box . they contain any string you type into the line edit field . additional hint for power users : this kdeprint gui element corresponds to the cups command line job option parameter : - o page - label = " . . . " # example : " company confidential " 
job priority usually cups prints all jobs per queue according to the " fifo " principle : first in , first out . the job priority option allows you to re - order the queue according to your needs . it works in both directions : you can increase as well as decrease priorities . ( usually you can only control your own jobs . ) since the default job priority is " 50 " , any job sent with , for example , " 49 " will be printed only after all those others have finished . conversely , a " 51 " or higher priority job will go right to the top of a populated queue ( if no other , higher prioritized one is present . ) additional hint for power users : this kdeprint gui element corresponds to the cups command line job option parameter : - o job - priority = . . . # example : " 10 " or " 66 " or " 99 "

an identification string . use only alphanumeric characters except spaces . the string _ _ root _ _ is reserved for internal use . 
a description string . this string is shown in the interface , and should be explicit enough about the role of the corresponding option . 
the type of the option . this determines how the option is presented graphically to the user . 
the format of the option . this determines how the option is formatted for inclusion in the global command line . the tag % value can be used to represent the user selection . this tag will be replaced at run - time by a string representation of the option value . 
the default value of the option . for non persistent options , nothing is added to the command line if the option has that default value . if this value does not correspond to the actual default value of the underlying utility , make the option persistent to avoid unwanted effects . 
make the option persistent . a persistent option is always written to the command line , whatever its value . this is useful when the chosen default value does not match with the actual default value of the underlying utility . 
the full command line to execute the associated underlying utility . this command line is based on a mechanism of tags that are replaced at run - time . the supported tags are : % filterargs : command options % filterinput : input specification % filteroutput : output specification % psu : the page size in upper case % psl : the page size in lower case
input specification when the underlying utility reads input data from a file . use the tag % in to represent the input filename . 
output specification when the underlying utility writes output data to a file . use the tag % out to represent the output filename . 
input specification when the underlying utility reads input data from its standard input . 
output specification when the underlying utility writes output data to its standard output .

remove file button this button removes the highlighted file from the list of to - be - printed files . 
move file down button this button moves the highlighted file down in the list of files to be printed . in effect , this changes the order of the files ' printout . 
file open button this button tries to open the highlighted file , so you can view or edit it before you send it to the printing system . if you open files , kdeprint will use the application matching the mime type of the file . 
file list view this list displays all the files you selected for printing . you can see the file name ( s ) , file path ( s ) and the file ( mime ) type ( s ) as determined by kdeprint . you may re - arrange the initial order of the list with the help of the arrow buttons on the right . the files will be printed as a single job , in the same order as displayed in the list . note : you can select multiple files . the files may be in multiple locations . the files may be of multiple mime types . the buttons on the right side let you add more files , remove already selected files from the list , re - order the list ( by moving files up or down ) , and open files . if you open files , kdeprint will use the application matching the mime type of the file .

page range : choose a " page range " to select a subset of the complete document pages to be printed . the format is " n , m , o - p , q , r , s - t , u " . example : " 4,6,10 - 13,17,20,23 - 25 " will print the pages 4,6,10,11,12,13,17,20,23,24,25 of your document . additional hint for power users : this kdeprint gui element corresponds to the cups command line job option parameter : - o page - ranges = . . . # example : " 4,6,10 - 13,17,20,23 - 25 " 
page set : choose " all pages " , " even pages " or " odd pages " if you want to print a page selection matching one of these terms . the default is " all pages " . note : if you combine a selection of a " page range " with a " page set " of " odd " or " even " , you will only get the odd or even pages from the originally selected page range . this is useful if you want to print a page range in duplex on a simplex - only printer . in this case you can feed the paper to the printer twice ; in the first pass , select " odd " or " even " ( depending on your printer model ) , in second pass select the other option . you may need to " reverse " the output in one of the passes ( depending on your printer model ) . additional hint for power users : this kdeprint gui element corresponds to the cups command line job option parameter : - o page - set = . . . # example : " odd " or " even " 
output settings : here you can determine the number of copies , the output order and the collate mode for the pages of your print job . ( note , that the maximum number of copies allowed to print may be restricted by your print subsystem . ) the ' copies ' setting defaults to 1 . additional hint for power users : this kdeprint gui element corresponds to the cups command line job option parameter : - o copies = . . . # examples : " 5 " or " 42 " - o outputorder = . . . # example : " reverse " - o collate = . . . # example : " true " or " false " . 
number of copies : determine the number of requested copies here . you can increase or decrease the number of printed copies by clicking on the up and down arrows . you can also type the figure directly into the box . additional hint for power users : this kdeprint gui element corresponds to the cups command line job option parameter : - o copies = . . . # examples : " 5 " or " 42 " 
collate copies if the " collate " checkbox is enabled ( default ) , the output order for multiple copies of a multi - page document will be " 1 - 2 - 3 - . . . , 1 - 2 - 3 - . . . , 1 - 2 - 3 - . . . " . if the " collate " checkbox is disabled , the output order for multiple copies of a multi - page document will be " 1 - 1 - 1 - . . . , 2 - 2 - 2 - . . . , 3 - 3 - 3 - . . . " . additional hint for power users : this kdeprint gui element corresponds to the cups command line job option parameter : - o collate = . . . # example : " true " or " false " 
reverse order if the " reverse " checkbox is enabled , the output order for multiple copies of a multi - page document will be " . . . - 3 - 2 - 1 , . . . - 3 - 2 - 1 , . . . - 3 - 2 - 1 " , if you also have en abled the " collate " checkbox at the same time ( the usual scenario ) . if the " reverse " checkbox is enabled , the output order for multiple copies of a multi - page document will be " . . . - 3 - 3 - 3 , . . . - 2 - 2 - 2 , . . . - 1 - 1 - 1 " , if you have dis abled the " collate " checkbox at the same time . additional hint for power users : this kdeprint gui element corresponds to the cups commandline job option parameter : - o outputorder = . . . # example : " reverse "

set the face values of the selected dice . the other player ' s dice will be cleared and it will be the dice ' s owner ' s turn . 
this is the bar of the backgammon board . checkers that have been kicked from the board are put on the bar and remain there until they can be put back on the board . checkers can be moved by dragging them to their destination or by using the ' short move ' feature . if the cube has not been doubled yet and if it can be used , its face shows 64 and if the cube can be doubled , double clicking it will do so . 
this is a regular field of the backgammon board . checkers can be placed on this field and if the current state of the game and the dice permit this , they can be moved by dragging them to their destination or by using the ' short move ' feature . 
this part of the backgammon board is the home . depending on the direction of the game , one of the homes contains the dice and the other one contains checkers that have been moved off the board . checkers can never be moved away from the home . if this home contains the dice and the current state of the game permits this , double clicking on the dice will roll them . moreover , the cube might be placed on the home bar and if it can be doubled , double clicking it will do so .

in this window you will develop your regular expressions . select one of the actions from the action buttons above , and click the mouse in this window to insert the given action . 
type in some text in this window , and see what the regular expression you have developed matches . each second match will be colored in red and each other match will be colored blue , simply so you can distinguish them from each other . if you select part of the regular expression in the editor window , then this part will be highlighted - this allows you to debug your regular expressions
ascii syntax :
