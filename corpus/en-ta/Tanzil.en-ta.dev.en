those to whom we have sent down the book know this even as they know their sons . yet a section among them conceals the truth knowingly . 
fight them till sedition comes to end , and the law of god ( prevails ) . if they desist , then cease to be hostile , except against those who oppress . 
their invocation will be : " all glory to you , o god , " and " peace " will be their salutation , and the end of their prayer ( will be ) : " all praise be to god , the lord of all the worlds . " 
( then going to their father ) they said : " o father , why don ' t you trust us with joseph ? we are in fact his well - wishers . 
surely god knows what they hide and what they disclose . he certainly does not love the proud . 
if any one of them said : " i am god besides him , " we should award him hell ; for this is how we requite the evil - doers . 
and those who are watchful of their acts of prayer . 
answered ( the lord ) : " they shall wake up repenting soon . " 
then all news will be blacked out for them , and they will not even ask one another . 
this is a commemoration . surely for those who take heed for themselves is an excellent place of return - - 
then the angels bowed before him in a body , 
those who disbelieve will say : " o lord , show us those among the jinns and men who had led us astray that we may trample them underfoot and make them wholly abject . " 
they are those on whom the sentence of god would be justified as on communities of jinns and men before them . they will surely perish . 
it is he who has sent his apostle with the guidance and the true faith , so that he may exalt it over every other creed . god is sufficient as a witness . 
neither does he speak of his own will . 
o lord , make us not an example of punishment for infidels , and forgive us , o lord . you are all - mighty and all - wise . " 
has not the account of those who disbelieved before come to you , who tasted the torment of their action , and for whom is grievous punishment ? 
but those who seek more than this will be transgressors ; 
so they began to think , even as you do , that god would not resurrect any one . 
and such fruits as they desire . 
witnessed by those who are honoured . 
what is the startling calamity ? 
those who believe without seeing ( the hidden ) , and keep the ( obligatory ) prayer established , and spend in our cause from what we have bestowed upon them . 
and they said , “the fire will not touch us except for a certain number of days” ; say , “have you taken a covenant from allah – then allah will certainly not break his covenant – or do you say something concerning allah what you do not know ? ”
those who believed , and those who migrated for the sake of allah , and fought in allah ' s cause – they are hopeful of gaining allah’s mercy ; and allah is oft forgiving , most merciful . 
so her lord fully accepted her ( maryam ) , and gave her an excellent development ; and gave her in zakaria’s guardianship ; whenever zakaria visited her at her place of prayer , he found new food with her ; he said , “o maryam ! from where did this come to you ? ” she answered , “it is from allah ; indeed allah gives to whomever he wills , without limit account . ” ( miracles occur through the friends of allah . ) 
so due to the great injustices committed by the jews , we forbade them some of the good things which were earlier lawful for them , and because they prevented many people from allah’s way . 
say , “what is your opinion – if the punishment of allah were to come upon you suddenly or openly ( with forewarning ) , who would be destroyed except the disbelieving people ? ”
and o listener ! if the devil provokes you , seek the refuge of allah ; indeed he is all hearing , all knowing . 
say , “what is your opinion – ( regarding ) the sustenance that allah has sent down for you ? so you have , on your own , deemed lawful and unlawful in it ! ” ; say , “has allah given you permission for it , or do you fabricate a lie against allah ? ”
“and with your mercy , rescue us from the disbelievers . ”
and do not wrongfully kill any living being which allah has forbidden ; and for whoever is slain wrongfully , we have given the authority to his heir , so he should not cross limits in slaying ; he will surely be helped . 
on the day when we shall summon every group along with its leader ; so whoever is given his register in his right hand – these will read their accounts and their rights will not be suppressed even a thread . ( * they will be given the full reward . ) 
do they not see that allah who has created the heavens and the earth is able to create people similar to them , and has set a term for them in which there is no doubt ? so the unjust do not accept without being ungrateful . 
so there she screened herself from them ; we therefore sent our spirit towards her – he appeared before her in the form of a healthy man . ( angel jibreel – peace be upon him . ) 
except as a reminder for one who fears . 
and when we commanded the angels , “prostrate before adam” – so they all prostrated , except iblis ; he refused . 
the angels said to them , “do not flee and return to the comforts that were given to you and to your homes , perhaps you will be questioned . ”
and said the leaders of his people , who disbelieved and denied the confronting of the hereafter – and we had given them comfort in the worldly life – that , “he is nothing but a human like you , he eats from what you eat and drinks from what you drink . ”
why was it not that the believing men and women , when you heard it , thought good of their own people , and had said , “this is a clear accusation” ? 
he said , “not like this ( any more ) ; both of you go with our signs , we are with you , all hearing . ”
“they are all my enemies , except the lord of the creation . ”
they are unworthy of it , nor can they do it . 
so if they do not obey you , then say , “indeed i am unconcerned with what you do . ”
“and i shall send a present to them , then see what reply the envoys bring . ”
o people ! you are dependant on allah ; and allah only is the independent ( absolute , not needing anything ) , the most praiseworthy . 
“so when i have perfected him and breathed into him a spirit from myself , ( you all ) fall down before him in prostration . ”
and if you ask them , “who has created the heavens and the earth ? ” , they will surely say , “allah” ; say , “what is your opinion regarding those whom you worship other than allah – if allah wills to cause me some hardship , so will they avert the hardship sent by him ? or if he wills to have mercy upon me , so will they restrain his mercy ? ” proclaim , “allah is sufficient for me ; the people who trust must rely only upon him . ”
the day on which the unjust will not gain any benefit from their excuses , and for them is the curse , and for them is the wretched home . 
did you not see those who dispute concerning the signs of allah ? where are they being diverted ? 
and this is how we sent the divine revelation to you ( o dear prophet mohammed – peace and blessings be upon him ) – a life giving thing , by our command ; neither did you know the book nor the detailed commands of religion , but we have made this qur’an a light by which we guide whomever we will from our bondmen ; and indeed you surely do guide to the straight path . 
the lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them ; if you people believe . 
indeed those who turn back after the guidance had become clear to them – satan has deceived them ; and made them optimistic of living for ages . 
indeed in this is an advice for anyone who keeps a heart , or listens attentively . 
a large group from the earlier generations . 
accept faith in allah and his noble messenger , and spend in his cause from what he has made you the heirs of ; so for those among you who accepted faith and spent in his cause , is a great reward . 
and they will say , “is there any one – any magician ? ”
and the mountains as pegs ? 
so he did not quickly enter the steep valley . 
in it descend the angels and jibreel , by the command of their lord – for all works . 
and so will his wife ; carrying a bundle of firewood on her head . 
and when we delivered you from the folk of pharaoh who were visiting you with evil chastisement , slaughtering your sons , and sparing your women ; and in that was a grievous trial from your lord . 
those are they that have bought error at the price of guidance , and chastisement at the price of pardon ; how patiently they shall endure the fire ! 
god desires to lighten things for you , for man was created a weakling . 
those who wait upon you and , if a victory comes to you from god , say , ' were we not with you ? ' but if the unbelievers get a share , they say , ' did we not gain the mastery over you , and did we not defend you from the believers ? ' god will judge between you on the resurrection day , and god will not grant the unbelievers any way over the believers . 
but whoso repents , after his evildoing , and makes amends , god will turn towards him ; god is all - forgiving , all - compassionate . 
indeed we sent to nations before thee , and we seized them with misery and hardship that haply they might be humble ; 
worthy to say nothing regarding god except the truth . i have brought a clear sign to you from your lord ; so send forth with me the children of israel . ' 
and when they smote their hands , and saw that they had gone astray , they said , ' if our lord has not mercy on us , and forgives us not , surely we shall be of the lost . ' 
what , do they associate that which creates nothing and themselves are created , 
it is he who has sent his messenger with the guidance and the religion of truth , that he may uplift it above every religion , though the unbelievers be averse . 
those before you , who were stronger than you in might , and more abundant in wealth and children ; they took enjoyment in their share ; so do you take enjoyment in your share , as those before you took enjoyment in their share . you have plunged as they plunged . those - - their works have failed in this world and in the world to come ; those - - they are the losers . 
there is no fault in the weak and the sick and those who find nothing to expend , if they are true to god and to his messenger . there is no way against the good - doers - - god is all - forgiving , all - compassionate - - 
so today we shall deliver thee with thy body , that thou mayest be a sign to those after thee . surely many men are heedless of our signs . ' 
and all that we relate to thee of the tidings of the messengers is that whereby we strengthen thy heart ; in these there has come to thee the truth and an admonition , and a reminder to the believers . 
they said , turning to them , ' what is it that you are missing ? ' 
whosoever desires this hasty world , we hasten for him therein what we will unto whomsoever we desire ; then we appoint for him gehenna wherein he shall roast , condemned and rejected . 
say : ' call upon god , or call upon the merciful ; whichsoever you call upon , to him belong the names most beautiful . ' and be thou not loud in thy prayer , nor hushed therein , but seek thou for a way between that . 
it is not for god to take a son unto him . glory be to him ! when he decrees a thing , he but says to it ' be , ' and it is . 
ta ha
we have not sent down the koran upon thee for thee to be unprosperous , 
saying , ' these two men are sorcerers and their purpose is to expel you out of your land by their sorcery , and to extirpate your justest way . 
but whosoever does deeds of righteousness , being a believer , shall fear neither wrong nor injustice . 
and surely they that believe not in the world to come are deviating from the path . 
now we have sent down signs making all clear ; god guides whomsoever he will to a straight path . 
who created the heavens and the earth , and what between them is , in six days , then sat himself upon the throne , the all - compassionate : ask any informed of him ! 
they said , ' if thou givest not over , noah , thou shalt assuredly be one of the stoned . ' 
he said , ' o my people , why do you seek to hasten evil before good ? why do you not ask forgiveness of god ? haply so you will find mercy . ' 
but moses said , ' my lord knows very well who comes with the guidance from him , and shall possess the ultimate abode ; surely the evildoers will not prosper . ' 
o believers , when you marry believing women and then divorce them before you touch them , you have no period to reckon against them ; so make provision for them , and set them free with kindliness . 
the word has been realised against most of them , yet they do not believe . 
he led astray many a throng of you ; did you not understand ? 
roast well in it today , for that you were unbelievers ! ' 
even so we recompense the good - doers ; 
he who appointed the earth to be a cradle for you , and appointed ways for you therein , that haply you may be guided ; 
ha mim
and i take refuge in my lord and your lord , lest you should stone me . 
and we chose them , out of a knowledge , above all beings , 
say : ' god gives you life , then makes you die , then he shall gather you to the day of resurrection , wherein is no doubt , but most men do not know . ' 
and we had established them in that wherein we have not established you , and we appointed for them hearing , and sight , and hearts ; and yet their hearing , their sight and their hearts availed them nothing , since they denied the signs of god , and they were encompassed by that they mocked at . 
and every soul shall come , and with it a driver and a witness . 
' cast , you twain , into gehenna every froward unbeliever , 
then which of thy lord ' s bounties disputest thou ? 
nay , but the hour is their tryst , and the hour is very calamitous and bitter . 
he created man of a clay like the potter ' s , 
like satan , when he said to man , ' disbelieve ' ; then , when he disbelieved , he said , ' surely i am quit of you . surely i fear god , the lord of all being . ' 
guiding to rectitude . we believe in it , and we will not associate with our lord anyone . 
upon that day man shall say , ' whither to flee ? ' 
of a sperm - drop he created him , and determined him , 
those - - they are the unbelievers , the libertines . 
when they measure against the people , take full measure
with their striving well - pleased , 
the like of which was never created in the land , 
what thinkest thou ? if he were upon guidance
roaring over the hearts
the king of men , 
and ibrahim enjoined his sons the same and did ya ' qub also , saying : o my sons ! verily allah hath chosen for you the religion , so die not except ye be muslims . 
then they vanquished them by the leave of allah , and da ' ud slew jalut , and allah vouchsafed him dominion , and wisdom and taught him of that which he willed . and , it not for allah ' s repelling people , some of them by means of others , the earth surely were corrupted ; but allah is gracious unto the worlds . 
if ye disclose the alms , even so it is well , and if ye hide them and give them unto the poor , it will be better for you and he will expiate some of your misdeeds allah is of that which ye work aware . 
after the wont of the people of fir ' awn and those before them . they belied our signs , wherefore allah laid hold of them for their sins . and allah is severe in chastising . 
o o ye who believe ! be not like unto those who disbelieve and say of their brethren when they journey in the land or go to religious war : had they been with , they had not died nor had they been slain ; this is in order that allah may cause an anguish in their hearts . and it is allah who maketh alive and causeth to die , and allah is of that which ye work beholder . 
and whosoever disobeyeth allah and his apostle , and transgresseth his statutes , him he shall cause to enter the fire , as an abider therein ; and unto him shall be a torment ignominous . 
hast thou not observed those who hold themselves purified nay ! allah purifieth whomsoever he will , and they shall not be wronged a whit . 
listeners are they to falsehood , devourers of the forbidden . wherefore if they come to thee , either judge between them or turn away from them . and if thou turnest away from them , they shall not be able to hurt thee in aught ; and if thou judgest , judge between them with equity , verily allah loveth the equitable . 
then the people who committed wrong were cut off completely . and all praise is unto allah , the lord of the worlds . 
and assuredly we established you in the earth and appointed for you livelihoods therein ; yet little thanks ye return . 
the twain said . our lord ! we have wronged our souls , and if thou forgivest us not and hath not mercy on us , we shall of a surety be of the losers . 
and assuredly we laid hold of the people of fir ' awn with lean years and lack of fruits , that haply they might dread . 
their lord giveth them glad tidings of a mercy from him and of goodwill and of the gardens wherein theirs will be a delight lasting : 
they are those who repent , who worship who praise , who fast constantly , woo bow down , who prostrate themselves , who command the reputable and restrain from the disreputable and who keep the ordinances of allah ; and bear thou glad tidings to the believers . 
he it is who hath made the sun a glow and the moon a light , and hath determined mansions for her that ye may know the number of the years and the reckoning allah hath not created all this except with a purpose ; he detaileth these signs unto those who know . 
he said : bethink ye , o my people ! if i rested upon an evidence from my lord , and a mercy hath come unto me from him , and that hath been obscured unto you , shall we make you adhere to it while ye are averse thereto ? 
respited were they until when the apostles had despaired and imagined that they were deluded , there came unto them our succour ; then whomsoever we willed was delivered . las and our wrath is not warded off from a people sinful . 
and not an apostle came unto them but at him they were wont to mock . 
and make not your oaths a means of discord amongst you lest a foot may slip after the fixture thereof , and ye may taste evil for having hindered others from the way of allah , and unto you there shall be a torment mighty . 
say thou : i only warn you by the revelation ; and the deaf hearken not unto the call when they are warned . 
- they will say we tarried a day or part of a day ; ask those who keep count . 
and the fifth that allah ' s wrath be upon her if he is of the truthtellers . 
and how many a moving creature there is that beareth not its provision ! allah provideth for it and for you . and he is the hearer , the knower . 
women are not allowed unto thee henceforth , nor mayest thou change them for other wives although their beauty please thee , save those whom thy right hand shall own ; and allah is ever over everything a watcher . 
roast therein to - day for that ye have been disbelieving . 
verily we ! thus we recompense the well - doers . 
for them ! above them shall be coverings of fire and beneath them coverings . therewith allah affrighteth his bondmen . o my bondmen ! wherefore fear me . 
and a believing man of fir ' awn ' s household , hiding his belief , said : would ye slay a man because he saith : my lord is god , and hath come upto you with evidences from your lord ? if he is a liar , then upon him will be his lie , and if he is a truth - teller , then there will befall you some of that wherewith he threateneth you ; verily god guideth not one who is an extravagant and a liar . 
this is a revelation from the compassionate , the merciful - 
by the luminious book . 
the life of the world is but a sport and a pastime . and if ye believe and fear , he will give you your hire , and will not require of you your substance . 
which , then , of the benefits of your lord will ye twain belie ? 
and shall be drinkers thereon of boiling water . 
o ye who believe ! fear allah , and let every soul look to that which it sendeth forward for the morrow . and fear allah ; veril allah is aware of that which ye work . 
they said : woe unto us ! verily we ! we have been arrogant . 
and let me alone with the beliers , owners of ease : and respite thou them a little . 
and it hearkeneth to its lord , and is duteous . 
then maketh it to stubble dusky . 
and thy lord shall come and the angels , rank on rank . 
nor are ye the worshippers of that which i worship . 
this is because your lord would not destroy the ( populations of ) towns for their wrong - doing ( i . e . associating others in worship along with allah ) while their people were unaware ( so the messengers were sent ) . 
verily , those who belie our ayat ( proofs , evidences , verses , lessons , signs , revelations , etc . ) and treat them with arrogance , for them the gates of heaven will not be opened , and they will not enter paradise until the camel goes through the eye of the needle ( which is impossible ) . thus do we recompense the mujrimun ( criminals , polytheists , sinners , etc . ) . 
it is not for a prophet that he should have prisoners of war ( and free them with ransom ) until he had made a great slaughter ( among his enemies ) in the land . you desire the good of this world ( i . e . the money of ransom for freeing the captives ) , but allah desires ( for you ) the hereafter . and allah is all - mighty , all - wise . 
but if they violate their oaths after their covenant , and attack your religion with disapproval and criticism then fight ( you ) the leaders of disbelief ( chiefs of quraish - pagans of makkah ) - for surely their oaths are nothing to them - so that they may stop ( evil actions ) . 
and the first to embrace islam of the muhajirun ( those who migrated from makkah to al - madinah ) and the ansar ( the citizens of al - madinah who helped and gave aid to the muhajirun ) and also those who followed them exactly ( in faith ) . allah is well - pleased with them as they are well - pleased with him . he has prepared for them gardens under which rivers flow ( paradise ) , to dwell therein forever . that is the supreme success . 
thus is the word of your lord justified against those who rebel ( disobey allah ) that they will not believe ( in the oneness of allah and in muhammad saw as the messenger of allah ) . 
they , turning towards them , said : " what is it that you have missed ? " 
indeed , they planned their plot , and their plot was with allah , though their plot was a great ( one , still ) it would never be able to remove the mountains ( real mountains or the islamic law ) from their places ( as it is of no importance ) [ tafsir ibn kathir , vol . 2 , page 597 ] . [ it is said by some interpreters regarding this verse that the quraish pagans plotted against prophet muhammad saw to kill him but they failed and were unable to carry out their plot which they plotted ] . 
his companion said to him , during the talk with him : " do you disbelieve in him who created you out of dust ( i . e . your father adam ) , then out of nutfah ( mixed semen drops of male and female discharge ) , then fashioned you into a man ? 
there ( on the day of resurrection ) , al - walayah ( the protection , power , authority and kingdom ) will be for allah ( alone ) , the true god . he ( allah ) is the best for reward and the best for the final end . ( la ilaha ill - allah none has the right to be worshipped but allah ) . 
so bear patiently ( o muhammad saw ) what they say , and glorify the praises of your lord before the rising of the sun , and before its setting , and during some of the hours of the night , and at the sides of the day ( an indication for the five compulsory congregational prayers ) , that you may become pleased with the reward which allah shall give you . 
and the messenger ( muhammad saw ) will say : " o my lord ! verily , my people deserted this quran ( neither listened to it , nor acted on its laws and orders ) . 
and make me one of the inheritors of the paradise of delight ; 
" so fear allah , keep your duty to him , and obey me . 
being miserly towards you ( as regards help and aid in allah ' s cause ) . then when fear comes , you will see them looking to you , their eyes revolving like ( those of ) one over whom hovers death , but when the fear departs , they will smite you with sharp tongues , miserly towards ( spending anything in any ) good ( and only covetous of booty and wealth ) . such have not believed . therefore allah makes their deeds fruitless , and that is ever easy for allah . 
" to whom comes a disgracing torment , and on whom descends an everlasting torment . " 
yes ! verily , there came to you my ayat ( proofs , evidences , verses , lessons , signs , revelations , etc . ) and you denied them , and were proud and were among the disbelievers . 
" and o my people ! how is it that i call you to salvation while you call me to the fire ! 
( the learned men ) refer to him ( alone ) the knowledge of the hour . no fruit comes out of its sheath , nor does a female conceive ( within her womb ) , nor brings forth ( young ) , except by his knowledge . and on the day when he will call unto them ( polytheists ) ( saying ) : " where are my ( so - called ) partners ( whom you did invent ) ? " they will say : " we inform you that none of us bears witness to it ( that they are your partners ) ! " 
like the boiling of scalding water . 
o you who believe ! when you ( want to ) consult the messenger ( muhammad saw ) in private , spend something in charity before your private consultation . that will be better and purer for you . but if you find not ( the means for it ) , then verily , allah is oft - forgiving , most merciful . 
say ( o muhammad saw ) : " the knowledge ( of its exact time ) is with allah only , and i am only a plain warner . " 
then leave me alone with such as belie this quran . we shall punish them gradually from directions they perceive not . 
verily , thus we reward the muhsinun ( good - doers ) . 
you will find others who want security from you , and security from their own people . but whenever they are tempted into civil discord , they plunge into it . so if they do not withdraw from you , nor offer you peace , nor restrain their hands , seize them and execute them wherever you find them . against these , we have given you clear authorization . 
o you who believe ! do not violate god’s sacraments , nor the sacred month , nor the offerings , nor the garlanded , nor those heading for the sacred house seeking blessings from their lord and approval . when you have left the pilgrim sanctity , you may hunt . and let not the hatred of people who barred you from the sacred mosque incite you to aggression . and cooperate with one another in virtuous conduct and conscience , and do not cooperate with one another in sin and hostility . and fear god . god is severe in punishment . 
if you find their rejection hard to bear , then if you can , seek a tunnel into the earth , or a stairway into the heaven , and bring them a sign . had god willed , he could have gathered them to guidance . so do not be of the ignorant . 
it is he who produces gardens , both cultivated and wild , and date - palms , and crops of diverse tastes , and olives and pomegranates , similar and dissimilar . eat of its fruit when it yields , and give its due on the day of its harvest , and do not waste . he does not love the wasteful . 
or lest you say , “had the scripture been revealed to us , we would have been better guided than they . ” clarification has come to you from your lord , and guidance , and mercy . who then does greater wrong than he who gives the lie to god ' s messages , and turns away from them ? we will repay those who turn away from our messages with the worst kind of punishment , because of their turning away . 
say , “who provides for you from the heaven and the earth ? and who controls the hearing and the sight ? and who produces the living from the dead , and produces the dead from the living ? and who governs the order ? ” they will say , “god . ” say , “will you not be careful ? ”
and as for those who are happy , they will be in paradise , remaining therein for as long as the heavens and the earth endure , except as your lord wills—a reward without end . 
or its water will sink into the ground , and you will be unable to draw it . ”
we have sent down to you clarifying revelations , and examples of those who passed on before you , and advice for the righteous . 
it is indeed a miserable residence and destination . ”
and we rained upon them a rain . miserable was the rain of those forewarned . 
say , “perhaps some of what you are impatient for has drawn near . ”
and aad and thamood . it has become clear to you from their dwellings . satan embellished for them their deeds , barring them from the path , even though they could see . 
the day when their faces are flipped into the fire , they will say , “if only we had obeyed god and obeyed the messenger . ”
god be glorified , far above what they allege . 
and they say , “our lord , hasten your writ upon us , before the day of account . ”
we committed the mountains to glorify with him , in the evening and at daybreak . 
instead of god ? ” they will say , “they have abandoned us . in fact , we were praying to nothing before . ” thus god sends the disbelievers astray . 
but when the truth came to them , they said , “this is sorcery , and we refuse to believe in it . ”
so how were my punishment and my warnings ? 
but for him who feared the standing of his lord are two gardens . 
and something else you love : support from god , and imminent victory . so give good news to the believers . 
and give from what we have provided for you , before death approaches one of you , and he says , “my lord , if only you would delay me for a short while , so that i may be charitable , and be one of the righteous . ”
he created the heavens and the earth with truth , and he designed you , and designed you well , and to him is the final return . 
no friend will care about his friend . 
and man says , “what is the matter with it ? ”
by no means . he will be thrown into the crusher . 
whoever earns evil and becomes engrossed in sin shall be doomed to hell and abide therein for ever . 
and whenever a messenger came to them from allah , confirming that scripture which they already possessed , some from among the people of the book threw the book of allah behind their backs as though they knew nothing about it . 
would you then ask your prophet such questions as were asked of moses in former times ? in fact , anyone , who changes the way of belief for that of disbelief , has surely swerved from the right way . 
there were those who responded to the call of allah and the messenger after injury had smitten them - for all those who do good and fear allah there is a mighty reward . 
among you there is such who lags behind , then if some affliction strikes you , he says : ' indeed allah bestowed his favour upon me that i was not present with them . ' 
had the people of the book only believed and been god - fearing , we should surely have effaced from them their evil deeds , and caused them to enter gardens of bliss . 
those who slayed their children in folly , without knowledge , . and forbade the sustenance that allah has provided them , falsely ascribing that to allah , are utter losers ; they have gone astray , and are certainly not among those guided to the right way . 
do you imagine that you will be spared without being subjected to any test ? know well that allah has not yet determined who strove hard ( in his cause ) , and has not taken any others instead of his messenger and the believers as his trusted allies ? allah is well aware of all that you do . 
and when our com - mand came to pass , we delivered hud , together with those who shared his faith , out of special mercy from us . we delivered them from a woeful chastisement . 
they said : " we will surely try to prevail over our father to send him . be sure we shall do so . " 
surely hell is the promised place for all of them . " 
those who associate others with allah in his divinity say : " were allah to will so , neither we nor our forefathers would have worshipped any other than him , nor would we have prohibited anything without his command . " their predecessors proffered similar excuses . do the messengers have any other duty but to plainly convey the message ? 
( xiv ) do not strut about in the land arrogantly . surely you cannot cleave the earth , nor reach the heights of the mountains in stature . 
these are the prophets upon whom allah bestowed his favour from the seed of adam , and from the seed of those whom we carried ( in the ark ) with noah , and from the seed of abraham and israel . they were those whom we guided and chose ( for an exalted position ) . they were such that when the words of the most compassionate lord were recited to them , they fell down in prostration , weeping . 
how numerous are the peoples that we destroyed before them ! do you now perceive any one of them , or hear even their whisper ? 
whenever any fresh admonition comes to them from their lord they barely heed it and remain immersed in play , 
had it been our will to find a pastime , we would have found one near at hand ; if at all we were inclined to do so . 
he answered : " rather it was this supreme one who has done it . so ask them , if they can speak . " 
and we sent among them a messenger from among themselves , saying : " serve allah ; you have no god other than he . do you have no fear ? " 
those among you , who are bountiful and persons of means , should not swear on oath that they would withhold their help from their relatives , the indigent and those who have left their homes for the cause of allah : they should forgive and forbear . do you not wish that allah should forgive you ? and allah is forgiving and merciful . 
do they not look at the earth , how we caused a variety of fine vegetation to grow from it ( in abundance ) ? 
pharaoh said : " did we not bring you up among us when you were a child ? 
what , you build a monument on every hill merely for fun
i am a trustworthy messenger to you . 
as for those who do not believe in the hereafter , we have made their deeds seem attractive to them so they stumble around in perplexity . 
but they denounced him as a liar . so a mighty earthquake overtook them , and by the morning they lay overturned in their houses . 
so give his due to the near of kin , and to the needy , and to the wayfarer . that is better for those who desire to please allah . it is they who will prosper . 
( o prophet ) , you cannot make the dead hear , nor can you make the deaf hear your call when they turn back in retreat , 
this book , beyond all doubt , was revealed by the lord of the universe . 
whenever it was said to them : “there is no true deity apart from allah , ” they waxed proud
before them a multitude of people of olden times had erred , 
we delivered him and his household from the great calamity ; 
while it is allah who has created you and all that you make ? ”
to him belong the keys of the heavens and the earth . it is those who disbelieve in allah ' s signs who will be the losers . 
allah will judge with justice , whereas those whom they call upon beside him cannot judge at all . surely allah - - and he alone - - is all - hearing , all - seeing . 
do they say : “he has forged a lie against allah ? ” if allah so wanted he could seal up your heart . allah blots out falsehood and confirms the truth by his words . he is well aware of all the secrets hidden in the breasts ( of people ) . 
( he did this ) to admit the believers , both men and women , to gardens beneath which rivers flow , wherein they shall abide , and to efface their evil deeds from them . that , in allah ' s sight , is the supreme triumph . 
and with the flesh of any fowl that they may desire to eat ; 
is it you who brought it down from the clouds or is it we who brought it down ? 
he is allah : there is no god but he ; the knower of the unseen and the manifest , he is the most merciful , the most compassionate . 
and the fruits that they desire ( will be ready at hand ) . 
surely there is a great lesson in it for whoever would fear ( allah ) . 
what is the calamity ? 
confound not truth with falsehood , nor knowingly conceal the truth . 
but if they desist , then lo ! allah is forgiving , merciful . 
and he commanded you not that ye should take the angels and the prophets for lords . would he command you to disbelieve after ye had surrendered ( to allah ) ? 
they believe in allah and the last day , and enjoin right conduct and forbid indecency , and vie one with another in good works . these are of the righteous . 
and unto thee have we revealed the scripture with the truth , confirming whatever scripture was before it , and a watcher over it . so judge between them by that which allah hath revealed , and follow not their desires away from the truth which hath come unto thee . for each we have appointed a divine law and a traced - out way . had allah willed he could have made you one community . but that he may try you by that which he hath given you ( he hath made you as ye are ) . so vie one with another in good works . unto allah ye will all return , and he will then inform you of that wherein ye differ . 
if only the people of the scripture would believe and ward off ( evil ) , surely we should remit their sins from them and surely we should bring them into gardens of delight . 
had we sent down unto thee ( muhammad ) ( actual ) writing upon parchment , so that they could feel it with their hands , those who disbelieve would have said : this is naught else than mere magic . 
those who ward off ( evil ) are not accountable for them in aught , but the reminder ( must be given them ) that haply they ( too ) may ward off ( evil ) . 
had allah willed , they had not been idolatrous . we have not set thee as a keeper over them , nor art thou responsible for them . 
forsake the outwardness of sin and the inwardness thereof . lo ! those who garner sin will be awarded that which they have earned . 
say : come , bring your witnesses who can bear witness that allah forbade ( all ) this . and if they bear witness , do not thou bear witness with them . follow thou not the whims of those who deny our revelations , those who believe not in the hereafter and deem ( others ) equal with their lord . 
how many a township have we destroyed ! as a raid by night , or while they slept at noon , our terror came unto them . 
and if they break their pledges after their treaty ( hath been made with you ) and assail your religion , then fight the heads of disbelief - lo ! they have no binding oaths - in order that they may desist . 
they worship beside allah that which neither hurteth them nor profiteth them , and they say : these are our intercessors with allah . say : would ye inform allah of ( something ) that he knoweth not in the heavens or in the earth ? praised be he and high exalted above all that ye associate ( with him ) ! 
but they hamstrung her , and then he said : enjoy life in your dwelling - place three days ! this is a threat that will not be belied . 
send him with us to - morrow that he may enjoy himself and play . and lo ! we shall take good care of him . 
and though thou try much , most men will not believe . 
even if thou ( o muhammad ) desirest their right guidance , still allah assuredly will not guide him who misleadeth . such have no helpers . 
then we gave you once again your turn against them , and we aided you with wealth and children and made you more in soldiery . 
that we may show thee ( some ) of our greater portents , 
they glorify ( him ) night and day ; they flag not . 
lo ! he knoweth that which is said openly , and that which ye conceal . 
we hasten unto them with good things ? nay , but they perceive not . 
and who feedeth me and watereth me . 
and noah verily prayed unto us , and gracious was the hearer of his prayer
is he who payeth adoration in the watches of the night , prostrate and standing , bewaring of the hereafter and hoping for the mercy of his lord , ( to be accounted equal with a disbeliever ) ? say ( unto them , o muhammad ) : are those who know equal with those who know not ? but only men of understanding will pay heed . 
and ornaments of gold . yet all that would have been but a provision of the life of the world . and the hereafter with your lord would have been for those who keep from evil . 
and pharaoh caused a proclamation to be made among his people saying : o my people ! is not mine the sovereignty of egypt and these rivers flowing under me ? can ye not then discern ? 
a mercy from thy lord . lo ! he , even he is the hearer , the knower , 
they said : o our people ! lo ! we have heard a scripture which hath been revealed after moses , confirming that which was before it , guiding unto the truth and a right road . 
( the tribe of ) a ' ad rejected warnings . then how ( dreadful ) was my punishment after my warnings . 
and a few of those of later time . 
those who disbelieve assert that they will not be raised again . say ( unto them , o muhammad ) : yea , verily , by my lord ! ye will be raised again and then ye will be informed of what ye did ; and that is easy for allah . 
that is the commandment of allah which he revealeth unto you . and whoso keepeth his duty to allah , he will remit from him his evil deeds and magnify reward for him . 
and show not favour , seeking wordly gain ! 
leave me ( to deal ) with him whom i created lonely , 
but man would fain deny what is before him . 
by the heaven , holding mansions of the stars , 
maybe allah will excuse them , for allah is all - excusing , all - forgiving . 
i desire that you earn [ the burden of ] my sin and your sin , to become one of the inmates of the fire , and such is the requital of the wrongdoers . ’
say , ‘o my people , act according to your ability ; i too am acting . soon you will know in whose favour the outcome of that abode will be . indeed the wrongdoers will not be felicitous . ’
that is how to most of the polytheists the slaying of their children is presented as decorous by those whom they ascribe as partners [ to allah ] , that they may ruin them and confound their religion for them . had allah wished , they would not have done it . so leave them with what they fabricate . 
but if they seek to betray you , then they have already betrayed allah earlier , and he gave [ you ] power over them ; and allah is all - knowing , all - wise . 
and made in it [ various ] means of livelihood for you and for those whom you do not provide for . 
those who are fought against are permitted [ to fight ] because they have been wronged , and allah is indeed able to help them
as for those whose deeds weigh light in the scales—they will be the ones who have ruined their souls , and they will remain in hell [ forever ] . 
on the day when witness shall be given against them by their tongues , their hands , and their feet concerning what they used to do . 
on that day , allah will pay them in full their due recompense , and they shall know that allah is the manifest reality . 
and we delivered moses and all those who were with him . 
these are nothing but the traditions of the ancients , 
‘o moses ! indeed i am allah , the all - mighty , the all - wise . ’
when the word [ of judgement ] falls upon them , we shall bring out for them an animal from the earth who shall tell them that the people had no faith in our signs . 
say , ‘allah suffices as a witness between me and you : he knows whatever there is in the heavens and the earth . those who put faith in falsehood and defy allah—it is they who are the losers . ’
when he absconded toward the laden ship , 
we would have surely been allah’s exclusive servants . ’
but they disbelieved it [ when it came to them ] . soon they will know ! 
the ground for action is only against those who oppress the people and commit tyranny in the land in violation of justice . for such there will be a painful punishment . 
and pharaoh proclaimed to his people , saying , ‘o my people ! do not the kingdom of egypt and these rivers that run at my feet belong to me ? do you not perceive ? 
that it is he who is the lord of sirius ; 
but they called their companion , and he took [ a knife ] and hamstrung [ her ] . 
there will be unleashed upon you a flash of fire and a smoke ; then you will not be able to help one another . 
who is a greater wrongdoer than him who fabricates falsehoods against allah , while he is being summoned to islam ? and allah does not guide the wrongdoing lot . 
[ though ] they will be placed within each other’s sight . the guilty one will wish he could ransom himself from the punishment of that day at the price of his children , 
yet it will be only a single shout , 
he created him from a drop of [ seminal ] fluid ; then proportioned him . 
it is a day when no soul will be of any avail to another soul and all command that day will belong to allah . 
and the mountains , how they have been set ? 
indeed it will close in upon them
owner of the day of recompense . 
allah will mock at them and prolong them in sin , blundering blindly . 
are they seeking a religion other than that of allah , and to him whosoever is in the heavens and the earth has submitted willingly and unwillingly . to him they shall be returned . 
but for those who fear their lord , for them shall be gardens underneath which rivers flow , there they shall live for ever , a ( goodly ) hosting from allah , and that which is with allah is better for the righteous . 
you will not be able to be just between your women , even though you are eager . do not be altogether partial so that you leave her as if she were suspended . if you reform and are cautious , allah is the forgiver , the merciful . 
those who disbelieve in allah and his messengers , and desire to divide between allah and his messengers ( by believing in him without them ) , and say , ' we believe in some ( prophets moses and jesus ) , and disbelieve in some of them ( such as prophet muhammad ) ' desiring to take between this ( and that ) a way ( between belief and disbelief ) 
should i seek a judge other than allah when it is he who has sent down the well distinguished book for you ? those to whom we have given the book know that it is the truth sent down from your lord , so do not be among the doubters . 
if allah touches you an affliction none can remove it except he ; and if he wills any good for you , none can repel his bounty . he causes it to fall upon whosoever of his worshippers that he will . he is the forgiving , the most merciful . ' 
he said : ' think , my nation ! if i have a clear sign from my lord and he has provided me with good provision , i do not desire to go behind you , taking for myself that which i forbid you . i seek but to reform as much as i can , my help comes only from allah . in him i have put my trust and to him i turn in penitence . 
we gave moses the book , but they differed regarding it , but for a word that preceded from your lord , it had been decided between them ; and they are indisquieting doubt of it . 
my fellowprisoners , one of you will pour wine for his lord whereas the other will be crucified , and birds will peck at his head . the matter you inquired about has been decided . 
whom the angels take while they were still harming themselves ' then they will offer submission , saying : ' we have done no evil ' no , surely allah knows what you have done . 
' begone ' said he . ' indeed , gehenna is your recompense , and the reward of those who follow you , an ample recompense . 
as for those who believe and do good works we do not waste the wage of whosoever does good works . 
( then ) we said : ' go to the nation who have belied our signs ' and we utterly destroyed them . 
fear him who has given you all the things you know . 
she said : ' o council , let me hear your counsel , concerning my affairs , for i am not used to deciding an affair until you bear me witness ' 
we shall in truth recite to you some of the news of moses and pharaoh for a nation who believe . 
saying : ' you used to come to us from the right hand ' 
say ( prophet muhammad ) : ' i am only a human like you , to whom it is revealed that your god is one god . therefore be straight with him and ask him to forgive you . woe to the idolaters , 
and we saved those who believed and feared allah . 
this is a warner from the warners of ancient times . 
and an abundance of fruits , 
allah has heard the words of her that reasons with you ( prophet muhammad ) concerning her husband and made her complaint to allah . allah has heard both of you discussing with one another . indeed , allah is the hearer , the seer . 
you shall believe in allah and his messenger and struggle for his way with your possessions and yourselves . that is better for you , if you but knew . 
he knows whatever is in the heavens and the earth and he knows all what you conceal and what you reveal . allah knows the innermost of the chests . 
as for your women who have despaired of further menstruating , if you are in doubt , then their waiting period is three months as well as those who have not yet menstruated . as for those who are pregnant , their term shall be the time they deliver their burden . allah will ease ( matters ) by his order for whosoever fears him . 
and have such fruits as they desire . 
and inspired it with its sin and its piety , 
say : ' i take refuge with the lord of daybreak
and [ recall ] when you slew a man and disputed over it , but allah was to bring out that which you were concealing . 
then , you are those [ same ones who are ] killing one another and evicting a party of your people from their homes , cooperating against them in sin and aggression . and if they come to you as captives , you ransom them , although their eviction was forbidden to you . so do you believe in part of the scripture and disbelieve in part ? then what is the recompense for those who do that among you except disgrace in worldly life ; and on the day of resurrection they will be sent back to the severest of punishment . and allah is not unaware of what you do . 
if you should raise your hand against me to kill me - i shall not raise my hand against you to kill you . indeed , i fear allah , lord of the worlds . 
and remember when you were few and oppressed in the land , fearing that people might abduct you , but he sheltered you , supported you with his victory , and provided you with good things - that you might be grateful . 
it is he who has sent his messenger with guidance and the religion of truth to manifest it over all religion , although they who associate others with allah dislike it . 
has there not reached them the news of those before them - the people of noah and [ the tribes of ] ' aad and thamud and the people of abraham and the companions of madyan and the towns overturned ? their messengers came to them with clear proofs . and allah would never have wronged them , but they were wronging themselves . 
but among the bedouins are some who believe in allah and the last day and consider what they spend as means of nearness to allah and of [ obtaining ] invocations of the messenger . unquestionably , it is a means of nearness for them . allah will admit them to his mercy . indeed , allah is forgiving and merciful . 
say , " who provides for you from the heaven and the earth ? or who controls hearing and sight and who brings the living out of the dead and brings the dead out of the living and who arranges [ every ] matter ? " they will say , " allah , " so say , " then will you not fear him ? " 
thus the word of your lord has come into effect upon those who defiantly disobeyed - that they will not believe . 
he said , " o my son , do not relate your vision to your brothers or they will contrive against you a plan . indeed satan , to man , is a manifest enemy . 
but if his shirt is torn from the back , then she has lied , and he is of the truthful . " 
and ask the city in which we were and the caravan in which we came - and indeed , we are truthful , " 
and inform them about the guests of abraham , 
indeed , abraham was a [ comprehensive ] leader , devoutly obedient to allah , inclining toward truth , and he was not of those who associate others with allah . 
he almost would have misled us from our gods had we not been steadfast in [ worship of ] them . " but they are going to know , when they see the punishment , who is farthest astray in [ his ] way . 
those upon whom the word will have come into effect will say , " our lord , these are the ones we led to error . we led them to error just as we were in error . we declare our disassociation [ from them ] to you . they did not used to worship us . " 
say , " have you considered : if allah should make for you the day continuous until the day of resurrection , what deity other than allah could bring you a night in which you may rest ? then will you not see ? " 
recite , [ o muhammad ] , what has been revealed to you of the book and establish prayer . indeed , prayer prohibits immorality and wrongdoing , and the remembrance of allah is greater . and allah knows that which you do . 
" peace upon noah among the worlds . " 
when they entered upon david and he was alarmed by them ? they said , " fear not . [ we are ] two adversaries , one of whom has wronged the other , so judge between us with truth and do not exceed [ it ] and guide us to the sound path . 
[ that ] i will surely fill hell with you and those of them that follow you all together . " 
they will have canopies of fire above them and below them , canopies . by that allah threatens his servants . o my servants , then fear me . 
and pharaoh said , " let me kill moses and let him call upon his lord . indeed , i fear that he will change your religion or that he will cause corruption in the land . " 
indeed , we have sent you as a witness and a bringer of good tidings and a warner
and in the heaven is your provision and whatever you are promised . 
as reward for what they used to do . 
then why , when the soul at death reaches the throat
and he who does not find [ a slave ] - then a fast for two months consecutively before they touch one another ; and he who is unable - then the feeding of sixty poor persons . that is for you to believe [ completely ] in allah and his messenger ; and those are the limits [ set by ] allah . and for the disbelievers is a painful punishment . 
have you feared to present before your consultation charities ? then when you do not and allah has forgiven you , then [ at least ] establish prayer and give zakah and obey allah and his messenger . and allah is acquainted with what you do . 
and if you have lost any of your wives to the disbelievers and you subsequently obtain [ something ] , then give those whose wives have gone the equivalent of what they had spent . and fear allah , in whom you are believers . 
woe , that day , to the deniers . 
an appropriate recompense . 
laughing , rejoicing at good news . 
o mankind , indeed you are laboring toward your lord with [ great ] exertion and will meet it . 
the believers and the emigrants from mecca who fight for the cause of god , indeed have hope in receiving the mercy of god ; god is all - forgiving and all - merciful . 
thus , ( muhammad ) , fight for the cause of god . you are only responsible for yourself . rouse the believers and perhaps god will stop the evil designs of the unbelievers . god ' s punishment and retribution is the most severe . 
one who commits sins has committed them against his own soul . god is all - knowing and all - wise . 
however , the learned among them ( the jews ) and the faithful believe in what god has revealed to you ( muhammad ) and to the others before you and those who are steadfast in prayer , pay their religious tax , and believe in god and the day of judgment . they all will receive a great reward from us . 
( recall ) when i inspired the disciples to have faith in me and my messenger . they said , " we have accepted the faith . lord , bear witness that we have submitted ourselves to your will " 
we will certainly question the people and the messengers sent to them . 
i must only speak what is true about god . i have brought you miracles from your lord ; therefore , let the children of israel go free " . 
believers , obey god and his messengers and do not turn away from him when you hear ( his commands ) . 
also , they would not have spent anything , great or small , for the cause of god or travel through a valley without god decreeing a reward for them far better than whatever they had done . 
what do those who ascribe falsehood to god think of the day of judgment ? god is generous to the human being , yet many do not give thanks . 
exercise patience ; god does not ignore the reward of those who do good . 
and will be subjected to condemnation until the day of judgment . " 
she took him to her people and they said , " mary , this is indeed an strange thing . 
had the truth followed their desires , the heavens and the earth and all that is in them would have been destroyed . we sent them the quran but they ignored it . 
he was called from a tree of the blessed spot of the bank of the right side of the valley when he appraoched it , " moses , i am god , the lord of the universe . 
and we glorify god " . 
( muhammad ) , warn them of the approaching day when because of hardship and frustration their hearts will almost reach up to their throats . the unjust will have no friends nor any intercessor who will be heard . 
woe to the pagans , who do not pay zakat and have no faith in the life to come . 
they transgressed against the command of their lord . so a blast of sound struck them and they were unable to do anything but stare . 
i do not expect to receive any sustenance from them or that they should feed me . 
- jinn and mankind - which of the favors of your lord would you then deny
we created the human being from the union of sperm and egg to test him . we gave him hearing and vision . 
which have the fragrance of musk . this is the kind of place for which one should really aspire . 
who collects and hordes wealth , 
for god ' s favors to them during their summer and winter journeys , 
the king of mankind , 
and we said : o adam ! dwell you and your wife in the garden and eat from it a plenteous ( food ) wherever you wish and do not approach this tree , for then you will be of the unjust . 
do you not know that allah ' s is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth , and that besides allah you have no guardian or helper ? 
then as to those who disbelieve , i will chastise them with severe chastisement in this world and the hereafter , and they shall have no helpers . 
if allah assists you , then there is none that can overcome you , and if he forsakes you , who is there then that can assist you after him ? and on allah should the believers rely . 
( this ) shall not be in accordance with your vain desires nor in accordance with the vain desires of the followers of the book ; whoever does evil , he shall be requited with it , and besides allah he will find for himself neither a guardian nor a helper . 
the followers of the book ask you to bring down to them a book from heaven ; so indeed they demanded of musa a greater thing than that , for they said : show us allah manifestly ; so the lightning overtook them on account of their injustice . then they took the calf ( for a god ) , after clear signs had come to them , but we pardoned this ; and we gave to musa clear authority . 
he said : so it shall surely be forbidden to them for forty years , they shall wander about in the land , therefore do not grieve for the nation of transgressors . 
and those whom you call upon besides him are not able to help you , nor can they help themselves . 
their lord gives them good news of mercy from himself and ( his ) good pleasure and gardens , wherein lasting blessings shall be theirs ; 
o prophet ! strive hard against the unbelievers and the hypocrites and be unyielding to them ; and their abode is hell , and evil is the destination . 
and there are those of them who hear you , but can you make the deaf to hear though they will not understand ? 
and yusuf ' s brothers came and went in to him , and he knew them , while they did not recognize him . 
say : become stones or iron , 
and whoever is blind in this , he shall ( also ) be blind in the hereafter ; and more erring from the way . 
and the magicians were cast down making obeisance ; they said : we believe in the lord of haroun and musa . 
musa said to them : cast what you are going to cast . 
and his hosts of the jinn and the men and the birds were gathered to him , and they were formed into groups . 
and your lord never destroyed the towns until he raised in their metropolis an apostle , reciting to them our communications , and we never destroyed the towns except when their people were unjust . 
surely the dwellers of the garden shall on that day be in an occupation quite happy . 
and we perpetuated ( praise ) to them among the later generations . 
when they entered in upon dawood and he was frightened at them , they said : fear not ; two litigants , of whom one has acted wrongfully towards the other , therefore decide between us with justice , and do not act unjustly , and guide us to the right way . 
so taste my chastisement and my warning . 
they make their oaths to serve as a cover so they turn away from allah ' s way ; therefore they shall have an abasing chastisement . 
on the day that he will gather you for the day of gathering , that is the day of loss and gain ; and whoever believes in allah and does good , he will remove from him his evil and cause him to enter gardens beneath which rivers flow , to abide therein forever ; that is the great achievement . 
that you have surely therein what you choose ? 
then he said : i am your lord , the most high . 
o soul that art at rest ! 
who do ( good ) to be seen , 
then celebrate the praise of your lord , and ask his forgiveness ; surely he is oft - returning ( to mercy ) . 
nor would he enjoin you to take the angels and the prophets as your lords ; how could he command you to be disbelievers after you have submitted to god . 
those who consume the property of orphans unjustly are actually swallowing fire into their own bellies ; soon they will burn in the blazing flame . 
if two men commit a like abomination , punish them both . if they repent and mend their ways , leave them alone . god is forgiving and merciful . 
when the affliction decreed by us befell them , they did not humble themselves , but rather their hearts hardened , for satan had made all their doings seem fair to them . 
do they feel secure against god ' s devising ? no one feels secure against god ' s devising except for those doomed to ruin . 
then your lord declared that , until the day of resurrection , he would send others against them to inflict terrible suffering on them . your lord is swift in retribution ; yet surely he is most forgiving and merciful . 
say , " o people , if you are in doubt concerning my religion , then [ know that ] i do not worship those whom you worship instead of god , but rather i worship god who will cause you to die , for i am commanded to be one of the believers . " 
" from this , " said joseph , " [ the nobleman ] should know that i did not betray him in his absence , and that god does not guide the plotting of the treacherous . 
the day we shall make the mountains move and you will see the earth laid bare , and we shall gather all mankind together and shall not leave any one of them behind . 
they shall forever dwell in the gardens of paradise , desiring no change . 
they have taken other deities besides god , so that they may be a source of strength for them . 
the all merciful settled on the throne . 
believers , do not enter other people ' s houses until you have asked their owners ' permission and greeted them . that will be the better for you , so that you may be heedful . 
have you not seen how your lord lengthens the shadows ? had he pleased , he could have made them constant ; then we placed the sun as an indicator for them , 
if they disobey you , say , " i bear no responsibility for what you do . " 
solomon then said , " o counsellors , which of you can bring me her throne before they come to me in submission ? 
this quran explains to the children of israel much of what they differ over , 
among his signs are your sleep , at night or in daytime , and your seeking his bounty . there truly are signs in this for people who hear . 
it is only by our mercy that they are granted provision for a time . 
a believer , a man from among the people of pharaoh , who had concealed his faith , said , " would you slay a man merely because he says , " my lord is god . " he has brought you clear signs from your lord , and if he is lying , the sin of his will be on his own head ; but if he is truthful , a part of that of which he warns you will surely befall you . certainly , god does not guide one who is a transgressor and a liar . 
then they turned away from him and said , " he is a madman , taught by others ! " 
believers ! if you succour god , he will succour you and make your footsteps firm . 
and that he himself created the two sexes : male and female , 
of what [ stuff ] has he created him ? 
who remembers the name of his lord and prays , shall indeed be successful . 
and on the earth , how it is spread out ? 
is there not in this strong evidence for a man of sense ? 
they said : " beseech on our behalf thy lord to make plain to us what she is : to us are all heifers alike : we wish indeed for guidance , if allah wills . " 
that was a people that hath passed away . they shall reap the fruit of what they did , and ye of what ye do ! of their merits there is no question in your case ! 
when it is said to them : " follow what allah hath revealed : " they say : " nay ! we shall follow the ways of our fathers . " what ! even though their fathers were void of wisdom and guidance ? 
many were the ways of life that have passed away before you : travel through the earth , and see what was the end of those who rejected truth . 
but every time we removed the penalty from them according to a fixed term which they had to fulfil , - behold ! they broke their word ! 
hath not the story reached them of those before them ? - the people of noah , and ' ad , and thamud ; the people of abraham , the men of midian , and the cities overthrown . to them came their messengers with clear signs . it is not allah who wrongs them , but they wrong their own souls . 
they will all be marshalled before allah together : then will the weak say to those who were arrogant , " for us , we but followed you ; can ye then avail us to all against the wrath of allah ? " they will reply , " if we had received the guidance of allah , we should have given it to you : to us it makes no difference ( now ) whether we rage , or bear ( these torments ) with patience : for ourselves there is no way of escape . " 
except for mercy from thy lord : for his bounty is to thee ( indeed ) great . 
say : " praise be to allah , who begets no son , and has no partner in ( his ) dominion : nor ( needs ) he any to protect him from humiliation : yea , magnify him for his greatness and glory ! " 
praise be to allah , who hath sent to his servant the book , and hath allowed therein no crookedness : 
that is their reward , hell , because they rejected faith , and took my signs and my messengers by way of jest . 
on those who believe and work deeds of righteousness , will ( allah ) most gracious bestow love . 
those who join not ( in worship ) partners with their lord ; 
those who slander chaste women , indiscreet but believing , are cursed in this life and in the hereafter : for them is a grievous penalty , - 
and the people of noah , - when they rejected the messengers , we drowned them , and we made them as a sign for mankind ; and we have prepared for ( all ) wrong - doers a grievous penalty ; - 
blessed is he who made constellations in the skies , and placed therein a lamp and a moon giving light ; 
he said : " here is a she - camel : she has a right of watering , and ye have a right of watering , ( severally ) on a day appointed . 
or , who originates creation , then repeats it , and who gives you sustenance from heaven and earth ? ( can there be another ) god besides allah ? say , " bring forth your argument , if ye are telling the truth ! " 
when trouble touches men , they cry to their lord , turning back to him in repentance : but when he gives them a taste of mercy as from himself , behold , some of them pay part - worship to other god ' s besides their lord , - 
behold ! a party among them said : " ye men of yathrib ! ye cannot stand ( the attack ) ! therefore go back ! " and a band of them ask for leave of the prophet , saying , " truly our houses are bare and exposed , " though they were not exposed they intended nothing but to run away . 
nay ! he has come with the ( very ) truth , and he confirms ( the message of ) the messengers ( before him ) . 
for he was one of our believing servants . 
except such as are ( themselves ) going to the blazing fire ! 
and that our forces , - they surely must conquer . 
say : " o ye my servants who believe ! fear your lord , good is ( the reward ) for those who do good in this world . spacious is allah ' s earth ! those who patiently persevere will truly receive a reward without measure ! " 
those who reject the message when it comes to them ( are not hidden from us ) . and indeed it is a book of exalted power . 
soon shall we settle your affairs , o both ye worlds ! 
with goblets , ( shining ) beakers , and cups ( filled ) out of clear - flowing fountains : 
is it such a message that ye would hold in light esteem ? 
nay , who is there that can help you , ( even as ) an army , besides ( allah ) most merciful ? in nothing but delusion are the unbelievers . 
we , when the water ( of noah ' s flood ) overflowed beyond its limits , carried you ( mankind ) , in the floating ( ark ) , 
but verily this is a message for the allah - fearing . 
as if they were affrighted asses , 
those who reject ( truth ) , among the people of the book and among the polytheists , will be in hell - fire , to dwell therein ( for aye ) . they are the worst of creatures . 
and raise the dust in clouds the while , 
for the covenants ( of security and safeguard enjoyed ) by the quraish ,
