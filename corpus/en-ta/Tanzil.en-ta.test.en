they ask you about menstruation . tell them : " this is a period of stress . so keep away from women in this state till they are relieved of it . when they are free of it , you may go to them as god has enjoined . for god loves those who seek pardon , and those who are clean . " 
who expend both in joy and tribulation , who suppress their anger and pardon their fellowmen ; and god loves those who are upright and do good , 
then two of the men who feared ( god ) , and to whom god was gracious , said to them : " charge and rush the gate . if you enter , you will surely be victorious . and place your trust in god if you truly believe . " 
we sent down the torah which contains guidance and light , in accordance with which the prophets who were obedient ( to god ) gave instructions to the jews , as did the rabbis and priests , for they were the custodians and witnesses of god ' s writ . so , therefore , do not fear men , fear me , and barter not my messages away for a paltry gain . those who do not judge by god ' s revelations are infidels indeed . 
when they come to you they say : " we believe ; " but unbelieving they came and unbelieving go ; and god is aware of what they conceal in their hearts . 
and they forbid others from ( believing in ) it , and themselves keep away from it . but they ruin none but themselves , and do not understand . 
you tell the unbelievers in case they desist whatever has happened will be forgiven them . if they persist , they should remember the fate of those who have gone before them . 
their lord announces to them news of his mercy , acceptance , and gardens of lasting bliss
the jews say : " ezra is the son of god ; " the christians say : " christ is the son of god . " that is what they say with their tongues following assertions made by unbelievers before them . may they be damned by god : how perverse are they ! 
in the alternation of night and day , and all that he has created in the heavens and the earth , are certainly signs for people who fear god . 
they will say all the same : " our eyes were dazed ( and clouded over ) . we were a people ensorcelled . " 
" go hence , execrable , " ( said the lord ) , " from this place , 
present to them the example of the life of this world so like the water we send down from the skies that mingles with the earth to nourish its vegetation , which then on the morrow turns to stubble and is blown away by the wind . god has power over everything . 
till he reached the point of the setting sun , and saw it set behind a muddy lake , and near it found a people . we said : " o dhu ' l - qarnain , you may either punish them or treat them with kindness . " 
by your lord , we shall gather them and the devils together , then bring them crawling on their knees around hell . 
so moses returned to his people full of anger and regret . " o my people , " he said , " did not your lord make you a better promise ? did the time of covenant seem too long to you ? or did you wish the wrath of your lord to fall upon you that you broke the promise you had made to me ? " 
they said " so long as moses does not come back we are not going to give it up , and we will remain devoted to it . " 
whose hearts are filled with awe when the name of god is mentioned before them , who endure with fortitude what befalls them , and fulfil their moral obligations , and expend of what we have given them . 
and do not withhold from people what belongs to them , and do not corrupt the land ; 
o my creatures who believe , surely my earth has plenty of scope and so worship only me . 
have you not seen that god has subjugated what is in the heavens and the earth to you , and bestowed his favours , external and esoteric , in abundance on you ? and yet there are men who contend about god without any knowledge or guidance or the book enlightening . 
the revelation of this book free of doubt and involution is from the lord of all the worlds . 
and kept far away . there is perpetual punishment for them , 
other than god , " ( the angels will be told ) , " then show them the way to hell , 
you have fulfilled your dream . " thus do we reward the good . 
but those who believe and do the right , and believe what has been revealed to muhammad , which is the truth from their lord , will have their faults condoned by him and their state improved . 
this is the law of god , effective as before : you will not find any change in the law of god . 
who are lost in deception . 
his is the kingdom of the heavens and the earth , and all things will go back to him . 
pleasing seem their persons when you look at them ; and when they talk , you listen to their speech . yet they are like the wooden panelling of a wall . they imagine every rebuke to be directed against them . they are the enemies , beware of them . may god damn them , how pervert are they ! 
they are the ones who say : " do not spend on those who are with the apostle of god till they break away ( from him ) . " to god belong the treasures of the heavens and the earth ; but the hypocrites do not understand . 
whilst it is no more than reminder for the people of the world . 
we had in fact thought that men and jinns would never speak a lie about god , 
we sought to pry into the secrets of the heavens , but found it full of fierce guards and shooting flames . 
did we not create you from contemptible water ? 
we raised over you several secure ( skies ) , 
the day the spirit takes its stand , with the angels ranged in rows . none will speak except who is permitted by ar - rahman and says what is right . 
a votary when he turns to his devotions ? 
and keep the prayer established , and pay the charity ; and whatever good you send ahead for yourselves , you will find it with allah ; indeed allah is seeing your deeds . 
those who say when calamity befalls them , “indeed we belong to allah and indeed it is to him we are to return . ”
undoubtedly safa and marwah * are among the symbols of allah ; so there is no sin on him , for whoever performs the hajj ( pilgrimage ) of this house ( of allah ) or the umrah ( lesser pilgrimage ) , to go back and forth between them ; and whoever does good of his own accord , then ( know that ) indeed allah is most appreciative ( rewards virtue ) , the all knowing . ( these are 2 hillocks near the holy ka’aba ) 
and they ask you the decree concerning menstruation ; say , “it is an impurity , so stay away from women at such times , and do not cohabit with them until they have cleansed themselves ; so when they have cleansed themselves , cohabit with them the way allah has determined for you” ; indeed allah loves those who repent profusely , and loves those who keep clean . 
the example of those who spend their wealth in allah’s way is similar to that of a grain which has sprouted seven stalks and in each stalk are a hundred grains ; and allah may increase it still more than this , for whomever he wills ; and allah is most capable , all knowing . 
it is the devil who threatens with his friends ; so do not fear them and fear me , if you have faith . 
they have indeed become disbelievers who say , “messiah , the son of maryam is certainly allah” ; say , “who can then do anything against allah , if he wills to destroy the messiah , the son of maryam , and his mother and everyone on earth ? ” and for allah only is the kingship of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them ; he creates whatever he wills ; and allah is able to do all things . 
o people who believe ! do not make the jews and the christians your friends ; they are friends of one another ; and whoever among you befriends them , is one of them ; indeed allah does not guide the unjust . 
and we have indeed sent noble messengers towards the nations that were before you – we therefore seized them with hardship and adversity so that , in some way , they may humbly plead . 
so when they forgot the advices made to them , we opened the gates of all things for them ; to the extent that when they were rejoicing for what they had received , we seized them suddenly , hence they remained dejected . 
and o listener ( followers of this prophet ) when you see those who argue in our verses , turn away from them until they engage in another topic ; and if the devil causes you to forget , then do not sit with the unjust after remembering . 
he said , “o my people ! there is no straying in me – i am in fact a noble messenger from the lord of the creation . ”
we therefore took revenge from them ; so we drowned them in the sea for they used to deny our signs and were ignoring them . 
so when our command came , we turned that township upside down and showered it continuously with stones of fired clay . 
“and he has made me blessed wherever i be ; and ordained upon me prayer and charity , as long as i live . ”
did you not see that for allah prostrate those who are in the heavens and in the earth , and the sun , and the moon , and the stars , and the hills , and the trees , and the beasts , and many among mankind ; and there are many upon whom the punishment has been decreed ; and he whom allah disgraces – there is none to give him honour ; indeed allah may do whatever he wills . ( command of prostration # 6 ) 
allah will judge between you on the day of resurrection concerning what you dispute . 
and had the truth followed their desires , then indeed the heavens and the earth and all those who are in them would be destroyed ; in fact we brought to them a thing in which lay their repute , so they are turned away from their own repute . 
and trust the living one who will never die , and praising him proclaim his purity ; and he is sufficient upon the sins of his bondmen , all aware . 
so it was ; and we made the descendants of israel its inheritors . 
proclaim , “what is your opinion – if allah makes it night continuously for you till the day of resurrection then , other than allah , who is the god who could bring you light ? so do you not heed ? ”
and when our verses are recited to him he haughtily turns away as if he did not hear them – as if there is deafness in his ears ; so give him the glad tidings of a painful punishment . 
in response they turned away – we therefore sent upon them a tremendous flood , and in exchange of their two gardens gave them two gardens bearing bitter fruit , and tamarisk , and some berries . 
and made the demons subservient to him , all builders and divers . 
“did we mock at them or did our eyes turn away from them ? ”
or may mix them , the sons and daughters ; and may make barren whomever he wills ; indeed he is all knowing , able . 
and doors of silver for their houses and couches of silver upon which they would recline . 
and it will never be lightened upon them , and they will remain in it devastated . 
therefore leave them , involved in their indecencies and play , till they confront their day which they are promised . 
those who deny the day of justice . 
and when moses said to his people , ' god commands you to sacrifice a cow . ' they said , ' dost thou take us in mockery ? ' he said , ' i take refuge with god , lest i should be one of the ignorant . ' 
our lord , it is thou that shall gather mankind for a day whereon is no doubt ; verily god will not fail the tryst . 
likewise confirming the truth of the torah that is before me , and to make lawful to you certain things that before were forbidden unto you . i have come to you with a sign from your lord ; so fear you god , and obey you me . 
and hold you fast to god ' s bond , together , and do not scatter ; remember god ' s blessing upon you when you were enemies , and he brought your hearts together , so that by his blessing you became brothers . you were upon the brink of a pit of fire , and he delivered you from it ; even so god makes clear to you his signs ; so haply you will be guided . 
what , do they not ponder the koran ? if it had been from other than god surely they would have found in it much inconsistency . 
and the unbelievers , who cried lies to our signs - - they shall be the inhabitants of hell . 
or lest you say , ' if the book had been sent down upon us , we had surely been more rightly guided than they . ' yet indeed a clear sign has come to you from your lord , and a guidance and a mercy ; and who does greater evil than he who cries lies to god ' s signs , and turns away from them ? we shall surely recompense those who turn away from our signs with an evil chastisement for their turning away . 
say : ' in the bounty of god , and his mercy - - in that let them rejoice ; it is better than that they amass . 
they said , ' in god we have put our trust . our lord , make us not a temptation to the people of the evildoers , 
to god belongs the unseen in the heavens and the earth . to him the whole matter shall be returned ; so serve him , and put thy trust in him . thy lord is not heedless of the things you do . 
and lower to them the wing of humbleness out of mercy and say ; ' my lord , have mercy upon them , as they raised me up when i was little . ' 
even so we have sent it down as an arabic koran , and we have turned about in it something of threats , that haply they may be godfearing , or it may arouse in them remembrance . 
glorifying him by night and in the daytime and never failing . 
hast thou not seen how that god has sent down out of heaven water , and in the morning the earth becomes green ? god is all - subtle , all - aware . 
then we drowned the others . 
those are their houses , all fallen down because of the evil they committed ; surely in that is a sign for a people who have knowledge . 
it is he who blesses you , and his angels , to bring you forth from the shadows into the light . he is all - compassionate to the believers . 
thou mayest put off whom thou wilt of them , and whom thou wilt thou mayest take to thee ; and if thou seekest any thou hast set aside there is no fault in thee . so it is likelier they will be comforted , and not sorrow , and every one of them will be well - pleased with what thou givest her . god knows what is in your hearts ; god is all - knowing , all - clement . 
surely we have sent thee with the truth good tidings to bear , and warning ; not a nation there is , but there has passed away in it a warner . 
he says , ' by god , wellnigh thou didst destroy me ; 
bear patiently what they say , and remember our servant david , the man of might ; he was a penitent . 
surely we have given thee a manifest victory , 
when evil visits him , impatient , 
he shall call for destruction
and what shall teach thee what is the steep ? 
knows he not that when that which is in the tombs is over - thrown , 
so pray unto thy lord and sacrifice . 
those unto whom we have vouchsafed the book recognise him even as they recognise their children ; and verily a party of them hide the truth while they know . 
verily in the creation of the heavens and the earth , and the alternation of night and day , and the ships that course upon the sea laden with that which profiteth mankind , and that which allah sendeth down of water from the heaven and quickenoth the earth thereby after the death thereof ; and scattereth therein of all kinds of moving creatures , and in the veering of the winds and the cloud subjected for service betwixt heaven and earth . are signs unto a people who understand . 
and as for those of you who die and leave wives behind , they shall keep them selves in waiting for four months and ten days . then when they have attained their period , no blame there is on you for that which they do with them selves reputably . and of that which ye work allah is aware . 
assuredly they have disbelieved who say : verily god : he is the masih , son of maryam , whereas the masih had said : children of isra ' il ! worship allah , mine lord and your lord ; verily whosoever associateth aught with allah , allah shall surely forbid the garden unto him , and his resort is the fire ; and for the wrong - doers there shall be no helpers . 
and assuredly mocked were the apostles before thee , wherefore that whereat they scoffed beset these who had been mocking . 
and thus we expound revelations so that the way of the culprits may be shown up . 
and this is a book we have sent down , blest , and confirming that which hath been before it . and it is sent that thou mayest warn thereby the mother of towns and those around it . and those who believe in the hereafter believe in it , and they guard their prayer . 
for them is an abode of peace with their lord ; and he shall be their patron for that which they have been doing . 
and of the camels he hath created a twain and of the oxen a twain . say thou : is it the two males he hath forbidden or the two females , or that which the wombs of the two females contain ? were ye present when allah enjoined this on you ? who then doth greater wrong than he who fabricateth a lie against allah that he may lead people astray ; verily allah shall not guide a wrong - doing people . 
verily allah hath bought of the believers their lives and their riches for the price that theirs shall be the garden : they fight in the way of allah and slay and are slain : a promise due thereon in the taurat , in the injil - and the qur ' an - and who is more faithful unto his covenant than allah ? rejoice wherefore in your bargain which ye have made . and that it is the mighty achievement . 
for these who answer their lord is ordained good . and those who answer not their lord - - if they had all that is in the earth , and therewith the like thereof , they would ransom themselves therewith . these ! for them shall be an evil reckoning ; and their resort is hell , a hapless bed ! 
and unsettle thou whomsoever of them thou canst with thy voice , and summon against them thine horse and thine foot , and share with them riches - and children , and promise unto them ; and the satan promiseth not but to delude . 
but he is allah , my lord ; and with my lord associate not anyone . 
and as for the boy , his parents were believers , and we apprehended that he might impose upon the twain exorbitance and infidelity . 
and assuredly we sent nuh unto his people , and he said : o my people ! worship allah ; for you there is no god but he ; will ye not then fear him ! 
and verily this religion of yours is one religion , and i am your lord , so fear me . 
then when the trumpet is blown there will be no lineage among them that day , nor will they ask of each other . 
and on the dav whereon he will gather them and that v ; hich they worship beside allah and will say . are ye the ones who sent astray these my bondmen ; or strayed they themselves from the way ! 
well nigh he had led us astray from our gods if we had not persevered towards them . presently they shall know , when they behold the torment , who , more astray in respect of path . 
so verily i am going to send a present unto them , and see with what answer the envoys come back . 
allah hath created the heavens and the earth in truth ; verily there in is a sign for the believers . 
and those who annoy the believing men and the believing women , without their earning it , shall surely bear the guilt of calumny and manifest sin . 
lord of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is in - between the twain , and lord of the easts . 
and verily of his sect was ibrahim . 
and had allah expanded the provision for his bondmen they surely would have rebelled in the earth , but he sendeth down by measure as he willeth ; verily he is , in respect of his bondmen . aware and beholder . 
and when he cometh to know aught of our revelations , he taketh it scoffingly . these ! theirs shall be a torment ignominous ; 
they are but names which ye have named , ye and your fathers , for which allah hath sent down no authority . they follow but their fancy , and that which pleaseth their souls ; whereas assuredly there hath come unto them from their lord the guidance . 
and that thamud ! he left not . 
o assembly of jinn and man ! if ye be able to pass out of the regions of the heavens and the earth , then pass out ; ye can not pass out except with authority . 
wherefore then - when the soul cometh up to the wind - pipe - 
clusters whereof shall be near at hand . 
what aileth those who disbelieve , toward thee hastening . 
woe on that day unto the beliers ! 
and that , when the qur ' an is read unto them , they prostrate not them - selves ! 
and with fir ' awn , owner of the stakes - 
thy lord hath not forsaken thee , nor is he displeased . 
by no means ! if he desist not we shall seize and deal him by the forelock - 
say to ( them ) : " if the home of the hereafter with allah is indeed for you specially and not for others , of mankind , then long for death if you are truthful . " 
say ( o muslims ) , " we believe in allah and that which has been sent down to us and that which has been sent down to ibrahim ( abraham ) , isma ' il ( ishmael ) , ishaque ( isaac ) , ya ' qub ( jacob ) , and to al - asbat [ the twelve sons of ya ' qub ( jacob ) ] , and that which has been given to musa ( moses ) and ' iesa ( jesus ) , and that which has been given to the prophets from their lord . we make no distinction between any of them , and to him we have submitted ( in islam ) . " 
beautified for men is the love of things they covet ; women , children , much of gold and silver ( wealth ) , branded beautiful horses , cattle and well - tilled land . this is the pleasure of the present world ' s life ; but allah has the excellent return ( paradise with flowing rivers , etc . ) with him . 
( remember ) when the angels said : " o maryam ( mary ) ! verily , allah gives you the glad tidings of a word [ " be ! " - and he was ! i . e . ' iesa ( jesus ) the son of maryam ( mary ) ] from him , his name will be the messiah ' iesa ( jesus ) , the son of maryam ( mary ) , held in honour in this world and in the hereafter , and will be one of those who are near to allah . " 
except those who join a group , between you and whom there is a treaty ( of peace ) , or those who approach you with their breasts restraining from fighting you as well as fighting their own people . had allah willed , indeed he would have given them power over you , and they would have fought you . so if they withdraw from you , and fight not against you , and offer you peace , then allah has opened no way for you against them . 
let the people of the injeel ( gospel ) judge by what allah has revealed therein . and whosoever does not judge by what allah has revealed ( then ) such ( people ) are the fasiqun ( the rebellious i . e . disobedient ( of a lesser degree ) to allah . 
" and if there is a party of you who believes in that with which i have been sent and a party who do not believe , so be patient until allah judges between us , and he is the best of judges . " 
and so the sorcerers came to fir ' aun ( pharaoh ) . they said : " indeed there will be a ( good ) reward for us if we are the victors . " 
one from among them said : " kill not yusuf ( joseph ) , but if you must do something , throw him down to the bottom of a well , he will be picked up by some caravan of travellers . " 
is then he , who creates as one who creates not ? will you not then remember ? 
then he followed ( another ) way , 
a revelation from him ( allah ) who has created the earth and high heavens . 
and when he came to it ( the fire ) , he was called by name : " o musa ( moses ) ! 
and thus do we requite him who transgresses beyond bounds [ i . e . commits the great sins and disobeys his lord ( allah ) and believes not in his messengers , and his revealed books , like this quran , etc . ] , and believes not in the ayat ( proofs , evidences , verses , lessons , signs , revelations , etc . ) of his lord , and the torment of the hereafter is far more severe and more lasting . 
and those who disbelieve will not cease to be in doubt about it ( this quran ) until the hour comes suddenly upon them , or there comes to them the torment of the day after which there will be no night ( i . e . the day of resurrection ) . 
and we shall take out from every nation a witness , and we shall say : " bring your proof . " then they shall know that the truth is with allah ( alone ) , and the lies ( false gods ) which they invented will disappear from them . 
and ( remember ) the day when he will gather them all together , and then will say to the angels : " was it you that these people used to worship ? " 
they ( people ) said : " for us , we see an evil omen from you , if you cease not , we will surely stone you , and a painful torment will touch you from us . " 
it was but one saihah ( shout , etc . ) and lo ! they ( all ) were silent ( dead - destroyed ) . 
so that they may eat of the fruit thereof , and their hands made it not . will they not , then , give thanks ? 
( the man ) said : " will you look down ? " 
( allah ) said : " then get out from here , for verily , you are outcast . 
say ( o muhammad saw ) : " o my slaves who believe ( in the oneness of allah islamic monotheism ) , be afraid of your lord ( allah ) and keep your duty to him . good is ( the reward ) for those who do good in this world , and allah ' s earth is spacious ( so if you cannot worship allah at a place , then go to another ) ! only those who are patient shall receive their rewards in full , without reckoning . " 
say ( o muhammad saw ) : " verily , if i disobey my lord , i am afraid of the torment of a great day . " 
those who dispute about the ayat ( proofs , evidences , verses , lessons , signs , revelations , etc . ) of allah , without any authority that has come to them , it is greatly hateful and disgusting to allah and to those who believe . thus does allah seal up the heart of every arrogant , tyrant . ( so they cannot guide themselves to the right path ) . 
verily , those who turn away from our ayat ( proofs , evidences , verses , lessons , signs , revelations , etc . by attacking , distorting and denying them ) , are not hidden from us . is he who is cast into the fire better or he who comes secure on the day of resurrection ? do what you will . verily ! he is all - seer of what you do ( this is a severe threat to the disbelievers ) . 
verily , they can avail you nothing against allah ( if he wants to punish you ) . verily , the zalimun ( polytheists , wrong - doers , etc . ) are auliya ' ( protectors , helpers , etc . ) to one another , but allah is the wali ( helper , protector , etc . ) of the muttaqun ( pious - see v . 2:2 ) . 
we created not the heavens and the earth and all that is between them except with truth , and for an appointed term . but those who disbelieve turn away from that whereof they are warned . 
( and it will be said ) : " both of you throw ( order from allah to the two angels ) into hell , every stubborn disbeliever ( in the oneness of allah , in his messengers , etc . ) . 
by ( the winds ) that scatter dust . 
should not he who has created know ? and he is the most kind and courteous ( to his slaves ) all - aware ( of everything ) . 
nay ! verily , he has been stubborn and opposing our ayat ( proofs , evidences , verses , lessons , signs , revelations , etc . ) . 
verily , the abrar ( pious , who fear allah and avoid evil ) , shall drink a cup ( of wine ) mixed with water from a spring in paradise called kafur . 
and grapes and clover plants ( i . e . green fodder for the cattle ) , 
so let man see from what he is created ! 
but if you are in fear , then on foot , or riding . and when you are safe , remember god , as he taught you what you did not know . 
but whoever disobeys god and his messenger , and oversteps his bounds , he will admit him into a fire , wherein he abides forever , and he will have a shameful punishment . 
he promises them , and he raises their expectations , but satan promises them nothing but delusions . 
they disbelieve those who say , “god is the third of three . ” but there is no deity except the one god . if they do not refrain from what they say , a painful torment will befall those among them who disbelieve . 
god will reward them for what they say—gardens beneath which rivers flow , where they will stay forever . such is the reward of the righteous . 
is he who was dead , then we gave him life , and made for him a light by which he walks among the people , like he who is in total darkness , and cannot get out of it ? thus the doings of disbelievers are made to appear good to them . 
they said , “our lord , we have done wrong to ourselves . unless you forgive us , and have mercy on us , we will be among the losers . ”
receive contributions from their wealth , to purify them and sanctify them with it ; and pray for them . your prayer is comfort for them . god is hearing and knowing . 
he will precede his people on the day of resurrection , and will lead them into the fire . miserable is the place he placed them in . 
these are of the reports of the towns—we relate them to you . some are still standing , and some have withered away . 
we did not wrong them , but they wronged themselves . their gods , whom they invoked besides god , availed them nothing when the command of your lord arrived . in fact , they added only to their ruin . 
when joseph said to his father , “o my father , i saw eleven planets , and the sun , and the moon ; i saw them bowing down to me . ”
and warn mankind of the day when the punishment will come upon them , and the wicked will say , “our lord , defer us for a little while , and we will answer your call and follow the messengers . ” did you not swear before that there will be no passing away for you ? 
he said , “do you remember when we rested by the rock ? i forgot about the fish . it was only the devil who made me forget it . and so it found its way to the river , amazingly . ”
and i will withdraw from you , and from what you pray to instead of god . and i will pray to my lord , and i hope i will not be disappointed in my prayer to my lord . ”
“we do not descend except by the command of your lord . his is what is before us , and what is behind us , and what is between them . your lord is never forgetful . ”
do not groan today . you will receive no help from us . 
my verses were recited to you , but you turned back on your heels . 
he said , “if you accept any god other than me , i will make you a prisoner . ”
i ask of you no payment for this . my payment is only from the lord of the worlds . 
but we established many generations , and time took its toll on them . nor were you among the people of median , reciting our revelations to them . but we kept sending messengers . 
there is no blame on them concerning their fathers , or their sons , or their brothers , or their brothers’ sons , or their sisters’ sons , or their women , or their female servants . but they should remain conscious of god . god is witness over all things . 
if the hypocrites , and those with sickness in their hearts , and the rumormongers in the city , do not desist , we will incite you against them ; then they will not be your neighbors there except for a short while . 
and watch them—they will soon see . 
who is more evil than he who lies about god , and denies the truth when it has come to him ? is there not in hell room for the ungrateful ? 
it is god who revealed the book with the truth , and the balance . and what will make you realize that perhaps the hour is near ? 
except for him upon whom god has mercy . he is the mighty , the merciful . 
say , “god gives you life , then he makes you die ; then he gathers you for the day of resurrection , about which there is no doubt . but most people do not know . ”
and the seething sea . 
they will exchange therein a cup ; wherein is neither harm , nor sin . 
to god belong the last and the first . 
perhaps god will plant affection between you and those of them you consider enemies . god is capable . god is forgiving and merciful . 
o you who believe ! let neither your possessions nor your children distract you from the remembrance of god . whoever does that—these are the losers . 
then they turned to one another , blaming one another . 
the day of sorting has been appointed . 
but how can you know what elliyyoon is ? 
and hearkens to its lord , as it must . 
believers , be steadfast , and vie in steadfastness , stand firm in your faith , and hold allah in fear that you may attain true success . 
indeed those who said : ' christ , the son of mary , he is indeed god ' , disbelieved . say ( o muhammad ! ) : ' who could have overruled allah had he so willed to destroy christ , the son of mary , and his mother , and all those who are on earth ? ' for to allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them ; he creates what he wills . allah is all - powerful . 
those who said : ' allah is one of the three ' , certainly they disbelieved , for there is no god save the one god . and if they do not give up this claim , all who have disbelieved among them shall be subjected to painful chastisement . 
thereupon allah will say : ' this day truthfulness shall profit the truthful . for them are gardens beneath which rivers flow . there they will abide for ever . allah is well - pleased with them , and they well - pleased with allah . that indeed is the mighty triumph . ' 
then we delivered hud and his companions by our mercy , and we utterly cut off the last remnant of those who called the lie to our signs and would not believe . 
and certainly we have created for hell many of the jinn and mankind ; they have hearts with which they fail to understand ; and they have eyes with which they fail to see ; and they have ears with which they fail to hear . they are like cattle - indeed , even more astray . such are utterly heedless . 
that you may seek forgiveness of your lord and turn to him in repentance whereupon he will grant you a fair enjoyment of life until an appointed term , and will bestow favour on everyone who merits favour . but should you turn away ( from the truth ) , i fear for you the chastisement of an awesome day . 
and he it is who created the heavens and the earth in six days - and [ before that ] his throne was upon the water that he may test you , who of you is better in conduct if you were to say ( o muhammad ) : ' all of you will surely be raised after death ' , then those who disbelieve will certainly say : ' this is nothing but plain sorcery . 
and joseph ' s brothers came to egypt and presented themselves before him . he recognized them , but they did not know him . 
except for those who were forced to engage in infidelity to allah after believing the while their hearts remained firmly convinced of their belief , the ones whose hearts willingly embraced disbelief shall incur allah ' s wrath and a mighty chastisement lies in store for them . 
the most compassionate lord is settled on the throne ( of the universe ) . 
surely we had bestowed wisdom upon abraham even earlier , and we knew him well . 
who gives me food and drink , 
nor does it behove them , nor does it lie in their power . 
they will then be told : " call upon those for help whom you declared to be our associates . " they will then call upon them but they will not answer them . they will have observed the chastisement in front of them . would that they were guided ! 
but they denounced him as a liar , so they will surely be arraigned ( for punishment ) , 
did he choose daughters rather than sons ? 
do they possess the treasures of your lord , the most mighty , the great bestower ? 
( o prophet ) , it is we who have revealed this book to you with truth . so serve only allah , consecrating your devotion to him . 
and abraham left behind this word to endure among his posterity so that they may return to it . 
so hold fast to what has been revealed to you . surely you are on the straight way . 
who hears allah ' s signs being rehearsed to him , and yet persists in his pride , as though he had not heard it . announce to him , then , the tidings of a grievous chastisement . 
they will say : “when we were living before among our kinsfolk we lived in constant fear ( of allah ' s displeasure ) . 
formerly we had always prayed to him . surely he is most benign , most compassionate . ”
had his lord not bestowed his favour upon him , he would have been cast upon that barren shore ( and would have remained there ) in disgrace . 
when the ten - months pregnant camels shall be abandoned , 
but those that believe and work righteous deeds , they are the best of creatures . 
they were descendants one of another . allah is hearer , knower . 
he said : my lord ! appoint a token for me . ( the angel ) said : the token unto thee ( shall be ) that thou shalt not speak unto mankind three days except by signs . remember thy lord much , and praise ( him ) in the early hours of night and morning . 
this day are ( all ) good things made lawful for you . the food of those who have received the scripture is lawful for you , and your food is lawful for them . and so are the virtuous women of the believers and the virtuous women of those who received the scripture before you ( lawful for you ) when ye give them their marriage portions and live with them in honour , not in fornication , nor taking them as secret concubines . whoso denieth the faith , his work is vain and he will be among the losers in the hereafter . 
he it is who sendeth down water from the sky , and therewith we bring forth buds of every kind ; we bring forth the green blade from which we bring forth the thick - clustered grain ; and from the date - palm , from the pollen thereof , spring pendant bunches ; and ( we bring forth ) gardens of grapes , and the olive and the pomegranate , alike and unlike . look upon the fruit thereof , when they bear fruit , and upon its ripening . lo ! herein verily are portents for a people who believe . 
this is the path of thy lord , a straight path . we have detailed our revelations for a people who take heed . 
thy lord is the absolute , the lord of mercy . if he will , he can remove you and can cause what he will to follow after you , even as he raised you from the seed of other folk . 
lo ! as for these , their way will be destroyed and all that they are doing is in vain . 
or deemed ye that ye would be left ( in peace ) when allah yet knoweth not those of you who strive , choosing for familiar none save allah and his messenger and the believers ? allah is informed of what ye do . 
even as those before you who were mightier than you in strength , and more affluent than you in wealth and children . they enjoyed their lot awhile , so ye enjoy your lot awhile even as those before you did enjoy their lot awhile . and ye prate even as they prated . such are they whose works have perished in the world and the hereafter . such are they who are the losers . 
and of the wandering arabs there is he who taketh that which he expendeth ( for the cause of allah ) as a loss , and awaiteth ( evil ) turns of fortune for you ( that he may be rid of it ) . the evil turn of fortune will be theirs . allah is hearer , knower . 
and ( remember ) when thy lord said unto the angels : lo ! i am creating a mortal out of potter ' s clay of black mud altered , 
( and it is said unto them ) : enter them in peace , secure . 
feel ye then secure that he will not cause a slope of the land to engulf you , or send a sand - storm upon you , and then ye will find that ye have no protector ? 
or thou have a house of gold ; or thou ascend up into heaven , and even then we will put no faith in thine ascension till thou bring down for us a book that we can read . say ( o muhammad ) : my lord be glorified ! am i aught save a mortal messenger ? 
do the disbelievers reckon that they can choose my bondmen as protecting friends beside me ? lo ! we have prepared hell as a welcome for the disbelievers . 
he said : my lord ! appoint for me some token . he said : thy token is that thou , with no bodily defect , shalt not speak unto mankind three nights . 
this is a blessed reminder that we have revealed : will ye then reject it ? 
the day when we shall roll up the heavens as a recorder rolleth up a written scroll . as we began the first creation , we shall repeat it . ( it is ) a promise ( binding ) upon us . lo ! we are to perform it . 
allah hath not chosen any son , nor is there any god along with him ; else would each god have assuredly championed that which he created , and some of them would assuredly have overcome others . glorified be allah above all that they allege . 
lo ! i am a faithful messenger unto you , 
hast thou not seen how they stray in every valley , 
in allah ' s help to victory . he helpeth to victory whom he will . he is the mighty , the merciful . 
and he hath coined for us a similitude , and hath forgotten the fact of his creation , saying : who will revive these bones when they have rotted away ? 
then , when they had both surrendered ( to allah ) , and he had flung him down upon his face , 
say ( o muhammad , unto mankind ) : i ask of you no fee for this , and i am no simulating . 
unto him is referred ( all ) knowledge of the hour . and no fruits burst forth from their sheaths , and no female carrieth or bringeth forth but with his knowledge . and on the day when he calleth unto them : where are now my partners ? they will say : we confess unto thee , not one of us is a witness ( for them ) . 
o ye who believe ! obey allah and obey the messenger , and render not your actions vain . 
and we left behind therein a portent for those who fear a painful doom . 
or were they created out of naught ? or are they the creators ? 
sweeping men away as though they were uprooted trunks of palm - trees . 
when the event befalleth - 
ye should believe in allah and his messenger , and should strive for the cause of allah with your wealth and your lives . that is better for you , if ye did but know . 
and when we heard the guidance , we believed therein , and whoso believeth in his lord , he feareth neither loss nor oppression . 
reclining therein upon couches , they will find there neither ( heat of ) a sun nor bitter cold . 
woe unto the repudiators on that day ! 
that is the true day . so whoso will should seek recourse unto his lord . 
have we not caused thy bosom to dilate , 
when they meet the faithful , they say , ‘we believe , ’ but when they are alone with their devils , they say , ‘we are with you ; we were only deriding [ them ] . ’
and those who have faith and do righteous deeds—they shall be the inhabitants of paradise ; they will remain in it [ forever ] . 
and kill them wherever you confront them , and expel them from where they expelled you , for persecution is graver than killing . but do not fight them near the holy mosque unless they fight you therein ; but if they fight you , kill them ; such is the requital of the faithless . 
and among them there are those who say , ‘our lord , give us good in this world and good in the hereafter , and save us from the punishment of the fire . ’
if you disclose your charities , that is well , but if you hide them and give them to the poor , that is better for you , and it will atone for some of your misdeeds , and allah is well aware of what you do . 
do they ascribe [ to him ] partners that create nothing and have been created themselves , 
when you do not bring them a sign , they say , ‘why do you not improvise one ? ’ say , ‘i only follow what is revealed to me from my lord ; these are insights from your lord , and a guidance and mercy for a people who have faith . ’
when you were on the nearer side , and they on the farther side , while the caravan was below you , and had you agreed together on an encounter , you would have certainly failed to keep the tryst , but in order that allah may carry through a matter that was bound to be fulfilled , so that he who perishes might perish by a manifest proof , and he who lives may live on by a manifest proof , and allah is indeed all - hearing , all - knowing . 
whenever a surah is sent down , there are some of them who say , ‘which of you did it increase in faith ? ’ as for those who have faith , it increases them in faith , and they rejoice . 
if you turn your back [ on me ] , i do not ask any reward from you ; my reward lies only with allah and i have been commanded to be of those who submit [ to allah ] . ’
the parable of the two parties is that of one who is blind and deaf and one who sees and hears . are they equal in comparison ? will you not then take admonition ? 
they said , ‘we miss the king’s goblet . ’ ‘whoever brings it shall have a camel - load [ of grain ] , ’ [ said the steward ] , ‘i will guarantee that . ’
it is allah who created the heavens and the earth , and he sends down water from the sky and with it he brings forth crops for your sustenance . and he disposed the ships for you [ r benefit ] so that they may sail at sea by his command , and he disposed the rivers for you . 
they are the ones whom allah has blessed from among the prophets of adam’s progeny , and from [ the progeny of ] those we carried with noah , and from among the progeny of abraham and israel , and from among those that we guided and chose . when the signs of the all - beneficent were recited to them , they would fall down weeping in prostration . 
then satan tempted him . he said , ‘o adam ! shall i show you the tree of immortality , and an imperishable kingdom ? ’
they said , ‘we found our fathers worshipping them . ’
o people ! listen to a parable that is being drawn : indeed those whom you invoke besides allah will never create [ even ] a fly even if they all rallied to do so ! and if a fly should take away something from them , they can not recover that from it . feeble is the seeker and the sought ! 
so set your heart on the upright religion , before there comes a day irrevocable from allah . on that day they shall be split [ into various groups ] . 
by the ones who recite the reminder : 
most of the former peoples went astray before them , 
this was indeed a manifest test . ’
he said , ‘my lord ! forgive me , and grant me a kingdom that will not befit anyone except me . indeed you are the all - munificent . ’
they will say to their skins , ‘why did you bear witness against us ? ’ they will say , ‘we were given speech by allah , who gave speech to all things . he created you the first time , and you are being brought back to him . 
were it not [ for the danger ] that mankind would be one community , we would have made for those who defy the all - beneficent , silver roofs for their houses and [ silver ] stairways by which they ascend , 
that is because allah is the protector of the faithful , and because the faithless have no protector . 
the imminent [ hour ] is near at hand . 
he created man out of dry clay , like the potter’s , 
in a guarded book
he is allah—there is no god except him—knower of the sensible and the unseen , he is the all - beneficent , the all - merciful . 
and those who are apprehensive of the punishment of their lord
and buxom maidens of a like age , 
and enter the blaze . 
we parted the sea for you , and , taking you to safety , drowned the family of pharaoh before your eyes . 
how shall allah guide a people who lapse into disbelief after they believed and bore witness that the messenger is true , and after receiving clear proofs ! allah does not guide the harmdoers . 
muhammad is not except a messenger ; messengers have passed away before him . if he dies or is killed , will you turn about on your heels ? and he who turns on his heels will not harm allah a thing . allah will recompense the thankful . 
whosoever takes allah for a guide , his messenger , and the believers the party of allah is the victor . 
there is no crawling creature on the earth , nor a bird that flies with its two wings , but they are nations like you . we have neglected nothing in the book . they shall all be gathered before their lord . 
lest you should say : ' the book was sent down only to two parties before us ; we are inattentive to their study ' 
in his absence , the nation of moses made a calf from their ornaments , a body with a hollow sound . did they not see that it could neither speak to them , nor guide them to a path ? yet they took it in worship and were harmdoers . 
he lifted his parents to the throne , and ( the others ) bowed before him . joseph said to his father : ' this is the meaning of my vision of long ago , my lord has verified it . he has been gracious to me . he brought me out of prison and brought you out of the desert after satan had corrupted ( the relationship ) between me and my brothers . my lord is gentle to whom he will . he alone is the knower , the wise . 
and he subjected to you the sun and the moon , which are constant in their courses . and , he has subjected to you the night and the day , and gave you all that you asked of him . 
allah knows without doubt what they hide and what they make known . he does not love the proud . 
to allah belongs the unseen of the heavens and the earth . the matter of the final hour shall be like the twinkling of an eye , or even less . allah has power over all things . 
say : ' lord , grant me an entrance of sincerity and an exit of sincerity , and give me from yours a victorious power ' 
when the youths sought refuge in the cave , they said : ' lord give us from your mercy and furnish us with rectitude in our affair ' 
say : ' none but allah knows how long they stayed . to him belong the unseen in the heavens and the earth . how well he sees , and how well he hears ! they have no other guardian , other than him , and he allows no one ( to share ) his rule ' 
from our mercy we gave him , his brother aaron , a prophet . 
thereafter the sorcerers threw themselves down , prostrating , saying : ' we believe in the lord of aaron and moses ' 
truly , they are expelled from hearing . 
go back then , we shall surely come against them with soldiers of which they have no power to oppose , and we shall drive them from there abased and humiliated ' 
forgive me , my lord , for i have wronged myself ' and so he forgave him ; for he is indeed the forgiving , the most merciful . 
the unbelievers say to those who believe : ' follow our path , and we will carry your sins ' yet they cannot carry even a thing of their sins . they are surely lying . 
such is the creation of allah ; now show me what , other than him , created ! no , the harmdoers are in clear error . 
there is neither sickness in it , nor intoxication . 
they replied : ' build for him a building and cast him into the fire ' 
or , lest it should say : ' if allah had only guided me i would have been one of the cautious ' 
( they shall be answered ) : ' that is because you disbelieved when allah alone was supplicated to , but when others were associated with him you believed . ' judgement belongs to allah , the most high , the great . 
' sorcerer ' they said , ' pray to your lord for us in accordance to the covenant he has made with you , and surely we shall be rightly guided ' 
yet they are in doubt , playing . 
they regard it as a favor to you that they have submitted ! say : ' do not regard your submission as a favor to me , rather , it is allah who bestows upon you a favor by guiding you to belief , if you are truthful ' 
and be patient under the judgement of your lord , surely , you are before our eyes . and exalt with the praise of your lord when you arise , 
believers , when you are called to prayer on the day of the congregation ( friday ) , hasten to the remembrance of allah and put your trading to oneside . that is the best for you , if you but knew . 
ask them , which of them will guarantee that ! 
and the mountains as pegs ? 
except to those who believe , and do righteous deeds , for theirs is an unfailing recompense . 
and pharaoh , of the pegs ( impaling his victims ) ? 
they were tyrants in the land
the month of ramadhan [ is that ] in which was revealed the qur ' an , a guidance for the people and clear proofs of guidance and criterion . so whoever sights [ the new moon of ] the month , let him fast it ; and whoever is ill or on a journey - then an equal number of other days . allah intends for you ease and does not intend for you hardship and [ wants ] for you to complete the period and to glorify allah for that [ to ] which he has guided you ; and perhaps you will be grateful . 
o you who have believed , do not invalidate your charities with reminders or injury as does one who spends his wealth [ only ] to be seen by the people and does not believe in allah and the last day . his example is like that of a [ large ] smooth stone upon which is dust and is hit by a downpour that leaves it bare . they are unable [ to keep ] anything of what they have earned . and allah does not guide the disbelieving people . 
indeed , those who reject the message after their belief and then increase in disbelief - never will their [ claimed ] repentance be accepted , and they are the ones astray . 
allah has certainly heard the statement of those [ jews ] who said , " indeed , allah is poor , while we are rich . " we will record what they said and their killing of the prophets without right and will say , " taste the punishment of the burning fire . 
have you not seen those who were given a portion of the scripture , purchasing error [ in exchange for it ] and wishing you would lose the way ? 
said two men from those who feared [ to disobey ] upon whom allah had bestowed favor , " enter upon them through the gate , for when you have entered it , you will be predominant . and upon allah rely , if you should be believers . " 
and they say , " why was there not sent down to him an angel ? " but if we had sent down an angel , the matter would have been decided ; then they would not be reprieved . 
has it not become clear to those who inherited the earth after its [ previous ] people that if we willed , we could afflict them for their sins ? but we seal over their hearts so they do not hear . 
if they could find a refuge or some caves or any place to enter [ and hide ] , they would turn to it while they run heedlessly . 
and whether we show you some of what we promise them , [ o muhammad ] , or we take you in death , to us is their return ; then , [ either way ] , allah is a witness concerning what they are doing
he will precede his people on the day of resurrection and lead them into the fire ; and wretched is the place to which they are led . 
and he said , " o my sons , do not enter from one gate but enter from different gates ; and i cannot avail you against [ the decree of ] allah at all . the decision is only for allah ; upon him i have relied , and upon him let those who would rely [ indeed ] rely . " 
he said , " do you know what you did with joseph and his brother when you were ignorant ? " 
it is allah who created the heavens and the earth and sent down rain from the sky and produced thereby some fruits as provision for you and subjected for you the ships to sail through the sea by his command and subjected for you the rivers . 
go , you and your brother , with my signs and do not slacken in my remembrance . 
and [ i swear ] by allah , i will surely plan against your idols after you have turned and gone away . " 
these are two adversaries who have disputed over their lord . but those who disbelieved will have cut out for them garments of fire . poured upon their heads will be scalding water
say , [ o muhammad ] , " to whom belongs the earth and whoever is in it , if you should know ? " 
do you not see that in every valley they roam
say , " then bring a scripture from allah which is more guiding than either of them that i may follow it , if you should be truthful . " 
and if you asked them , " who created the heavens and earth ? " they would surely say , " allah . " say , " [ all ] praise is [ due ] to allah " ; but most of them do not know . 
but they turned away [ refusing ] , so we sent upon them the flood of the dam , and we replaced their two [ fields of ] gardens with gardens of bitter fruit , tamarisks and something of sparse lote trees . 
and we gave him good tidings of isaac , a prophet from among the righteous . 
o my people , this worldly life is only [ temporary ] enjoyment , and indeed , the hereafter - that is the home of [ permanent ] settlement . 
and leave the sea in stillness . indeed , they are an army to be drowned . " 
indeed , those who call you , [ o muhammad ] , from behind the chambers - most of them do not use reason . 
[ they are ] reclining on beds whose linings are of silk brocade , and the fruit of the two gardens is hanging low . 
then [ for him is ] accommodation of scalding water
he created the heavens and earth in truth and formed you and perfected your forms ; and to him is the [ final ] destination . 
nor did he encourage the feeding of the poor . 
and i swear by the reproaching soul [ to the certainty of resurrection ] . 
indeed , we guided him to the way , be he grateful or be he ungrateful . 
and they will be given to drink a cup [ of wine ] whose mixture is of ginger
and what will his wealth avail him when he falls ? 
god is the originator of the heavens and the earth . whenever he decides to do anything , he just commands it to exist and it comes into existence . 
when his lord tested abraham ' s faith , ( by his words ) and he satisfied the test , he said , " i am appointing you as the leader of mankind . " abraham asked , " will this leadership also continue through my descendants ? " the lord replied , " the unjust do not have the right to exercise my authority . " 
if you will not give up the unlawful interest which you demand , know that you are in the state of war with god and his messenger . but if you repent , you will have your capital without being wronged or having done wrong to others . 
you cause the day to enter into the night and the night to enter into the day . you cause the living to come out of the dead and the dead to come out of the living . you give sustenance to whomever you want without keeping an account . 
( muhammad ) , say to the people of the book , " we must come to a common term . let us worship no one except god , nor consider anything equal to him , nor regard any of us as our lord besides god . " however , if they turn away from ( the truth ) , tell them , " bear witness that we have submitted ourselves to the will of god . " 
those who believe in god and seek his protection will receive his mercy , favors , and his guidance to the right path . 
( muhammad ) , say to the people of the book , " do you take revenge on us because of our belief in god and what he has revealed to us and to others before us ? most of you are evil - doers " . 
( muhammad ) , tell them , " i am commanded not to worship the idols instead of god . i do not follow your desires lest i go astray and miss the true guidance " 
the unbelievers planned to imprison , murder or expel you ( muhammad ) from your city . they make evil plans but god too plans and god ' s plans are the best . 
let not their property and children tempt you ; god wants to punish them through their things in this life so that their souls will depart while they are unbelievers . 
( muhammad ) , if god afflicts you with hardship , no one besides him can save you . if god grants you a favor , no one can prevent you from receiving his favors . god bestows his favors upon whichever of his servants he wants . god is all - forgiving and all - merciful . 
( muhammad ) , we told you that your lord has encompassed all mankind . we made the vision which we showed you and the condemned tree , mentioned in the quran , as a trial for the human being . even though we warn them , it only increases their rebellion . 
they try to annoy you so that they can expel you from the land . had they been successful , no one would have been left behind except a few . 
he said , " lord , how can i have a son ? my wife is barren and i have reached an extremely old age " . 
abraham said to himself , " by god ! i will devise a plan against their idols when they are away . " 
it is god who sends the winds to raise the clouds . he spreads them in the sky as he wants , then he intensifies them , and then you can see the rain coming down from the cloud . when he sends it down upon whichever of his servants he wants , they rejoice
except our mercy which could enable them to enjoy themselves for an appointed time . 
say , " i am afraid that for disobeying my lord i shall suffer the torment of the great day " . 
when the human being is afflicted with hardship , he cries out to us for help . when we grant him a favor , he says , " i knew that i deserved it . " in fact , it is only a test for him , but most people do not know this . 
it is god who has created the earth as a place for you to live and the sky as a dome above you . he has shaped you in the best form and has provided you with pure sustenance . this is god , your lord . blessed is god , the lord of the universe . 
have they not travelled through the land to see the terrible end of those who lived before them ? they were far mightier in both number and power and in what they had established . their ( worldly ) gains were of no benefit to them . 
hell is awaiting them and none of their deeds will be of any benefit to them , nor will any guardian whom they have chosen besides god . they will suffer a great torment . 
the lord will admit the righteously striving , believing people into his mercy . this is certainly a clear victory . 
has taught the quran to ( muhammad ) . 
who are as beautiful as rubies and pearls . 
how many a town has disobeyed its lord and his messenger ! for them our questioning was strict and our punishment severe . 
if you do , they will mislead your servants and will only give birth to ungrateful sinners . 
exercise patience to please your lord . 
and children living in his presence , 
they have said , " such a resurrection will certainly be a great loss " . 
and those who corrupt their souls will certainly be deprived ( of happiness ) . 
by no means ! they will be thrown into hutamah . 
say : if your fathers and your sons and your brethren and your mates and your kinsfolk and property which you have acquired , and the slackness of trade which you fear and dwellings which you like , are dearer to you than allah and his apostle and striving in his way , then wait till allah brings about his command : and allah does not guide the transgressing people . 
and those who disbelieve say : why has not a sign been sent down upon him from his lord ? you are only a warner and ( there is ) a guide for every people . 
he said : o iblis ! what excuse have you that you are not with those who make obeisance ? 
he said : the knowledge thereof is with my lord in a book , my lord errs not , nor does he forget ; 
those who , should we establish them in the land , will keep up prayer and pay the poor - rate and enjoin good and forbid evil ; and allah ' s is the end of affairs . 
and the chiefs of his people who disbelieved and called the meeting of the hereafter a lie , and whom we had given plenty to enjoy in this world ' s life , said : this is nothing but a mortal like yourselves , eating of what you eat from and drinking of what you drink . 
and when your lord called out to musa , saying : go to the unjust people , 
when he said to his father and his people : what do you worship ? 
say : travel in the earth , then see how was the end of the guilty . 
therefore rely on allah ; surely you are on the clear truth . 
as for those who believe and do good , the gardens are their abiding - place ; an entertainment for what they did . 
on a right way . 
and we did not send down upon his people after him any hosts from heaven , nor do we ever send down . 
do you not see that allah sends down water from the cloud , then makes it go along in the earth in springs , then brings forth therewith herbage of various colors , then it withers so that you see it becoming yellow , then he makes it a thing crushed and broken into pieces ? most surely there is a reminder in this for the men of understanding . 
certainly the creation of the heavens and the earth is greater than the creation of the men , but most people do not know
and they shall have no friends to help them besides allah ; and - - whomsoever allah makes err , he shall have no way . 
( the warner ) said : what ! even if i bring to you a better guide than that on which you found your fathers ? they said : surely we are unbelievers in that with which you are sent . 
until when he comes to us , he says : o would that between me and you there were the distance of the east and the west ; so evil is the associate ! 
say : have you considered if it is from allah , and you disbelieve in it , and a witness from among the children of israel has borne witness of one like it , so he believed , while you are big with pride ; surely allah does not guide the unjust people . 
such has been the course of allah that has indeed run before , and you shall not find a change in allah ' s course . 
and when it is said to them : come , the apostle of allah will ask forgiveness for you , they turn back their heads and you may see them turning away while they are big with pride . 
so they went , while they consulted together secretly , 
and we made above you seven strong ones , 
and hell is made to appear on that day . on that day shall man be mindful , and what shall being mindful ( then ) avail him ? 
nay ! i swear by this city . 
the first house to be built for mankind was the one at bakkah [ makkah ] . it is a blessed place ; a source of guidance for the whole world . 
his is all that the heavens and the earth contain . to god shall all things return . 
yet they are not all alike . of the people of the book there are some who stand by their covenant ; they recite the word of god during the night and prostrate themselves before him , 
those of the children of israel who were bent on denying the truth were cursed by david and jesus , the son of mary . that was because they disobeyed and were given to transgression ; 
on the day when we gather them all together , we will say to those who associated [ others with us ] , " where are those partners that you claimed ? " 
when a sign comes to them , they say , " we will not believe in it until we are given what god ' s messengers have been given . but god knows best whom to appoint as his messenger . humiliation before god and severe torment will befall the evil - doers for their scheming . 
he left them , saying , " my people , i delivered my lord ' s messages to you and counselled you sincerely , but you do not like sincere advisors . " 
o my people , do not let your opposition to me bring upon you a fate similar to the peoples of noah or hud or salih ; nor is it long since the people of lot were punished ! 
those who deny the truth say , " you are not god ' s messenger . " say , " sufficient is god as my witness between me and you , and those who have knowledge of the book . " 
he said , " you are strangers [ to me ] . " 
it is still there on the highway - - 
so they [ gog and magog ] were not able to scale it , nor were they able to bore through it , 
assuredly , you have uttered a monstrous falsehood : 
so he threw it down , and all of a sudden , it turned into a fast - moving serpent . 
" we were clearly misguided
and pharaoh ' s wife said , " he will be a joy to the eye for me and you ! do not slay him : he may well be of use to us , or we may adopt him as a son . " they did not realize what they were doing . 
as for the abode of the hereafter , we shall assign it to those who seek neither self - aggrandisement on the earth nor corruption . the righteous shall have a blessed end . 
the life of this world is nothing but sport and a diversion . it is the life of the hereafter which is the only true life , if they but knew it . 
you can warn only those who would follow the reminder and fear the gracious god , unseen . give them the good news of forgiveness and a noble reward . 
but now our lord ' s word has come true against us : truly , we are bound to taste [ the punishment ] . 
no indeed ! it is one of their fabrications when they say : 
my people , i fear for you the day you will cry out to one another , 
now if they turn away , we have not sent you [ o prophet ] as their keeper : your responsibility is only to convey the message . man is such that when we let him taste our mercy , he exults in it , but if an evil befalls him which is his own doing , he becomes utterly ungrateful . 
were we to ease the torment for a while , you would still revert to denial of the truth . 
on that day they shall be ruthlessly thrust into the fire of hell . 
this shall be their entertainment on the day of judgement . 
and he will forgive you your sins and admit you into gardens with rivers flowing under them . he will lodge you in fine dwellings in the gardens of eternity ; that is indeed the supreme achievement . 
certainly not ! they know quite well out of what we created them . 
so that he may know that the messengers have delivered the messages of their lord . he encompasses all that is with them and he keeps count of all things . 
o you who are wrapped up in your mantle , 
truly , we fear from our lord a woefully grim day . " 
and when the mountains crumble into dust
there they shall not hear any idle talk , or any untruth : 
and behold ! they will all come out in the open . 
but you cannot will it unless god , the lord of the universe , so wills it [ to show you that way ] . 
have we not given him two eyes , 
yet man behaves arrogantly , 
we said : " get ye down all from here ; and if , as is sure , there comes to you guidance from me , whosoever follows my guidance , on them shall be no fear , nor shall they grieve . 
" ' ( i have come to you ) , to attest the law which was before me . and to make lawful to you part of what was ( before ) forbidden to you ; i have come to you with a sign from your lord . so fear allah , and obey me . 
allah doth wish to turn to you , but the wish of those who follow their lusts is that ye should turn away ( from him ) , - far , far away . 
all who obey allah and the messenger are in the company of those on whom is the grace of allah , - of the prophets ( who teach ) , the sincere ( lovers of truth ) , the witnesses ( who testify ) , and the righteous ( who do good ) : ah ! what a beautiful fellowship ! 
o people of the book ! commit no excesses in your religion : nor say of allah aught but the truth . christ jesus the son of mary was ( no more than ) a messenger of allah , and his word , which he bestowed on mary , and a spirit proceeding from him : so believe in allah and his messengers . say not " trinity " : desist : it will be better for you : for allah is one allah : glory be to him : ( far exalted is he ) above having a son . to him belong all things in the heavens and on earth . and enough is allah as a disposer of affairs . 
they ask thee for a legal decision . say : allah directs ( thus ) about those who leave no descendants or ascendants as heirs . if it is a man that dies , leaving a sister but no child , she shall have half the inheritance : if ( such a deceased was ) a woman , who left no child , her brother takes her inheritance : if there are two sisters , they shall have two - thirds of the inheritance ( between them ) : if there are brothers and sisters , ( they share ) , the male having twice the share of the female . thus doth allah make clear to you ( his law ) , lest ye err . and allah hath knowledge of all things . 
unto allah belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth . he giveth life and he taketh it . except for him ye have no protector nor helper . 
if allah do touch thee with hurt , there is none can remove it but he : if he do design some benefit for thee , there is none can keep back his favour : he causeth it to reach whomsoever of his servants he pleaseth . and he is the oft - forgiving , most merciful . 
and thou wilt see the sinners that day bound together in fetters ; - 
nor sell the covenant of allah for a miserable price : for with allah is ( a prize ) far better for you , if ye only knew . 
" or thou cause the sky to fall in pieces , as thou sayest ( will happen ) , against us ; or thou bring allah and the angels before ( us ) face to face : 
" o my father ! to me hath come knowledge which hath not reached thee : so follow me : i will guide thee to a way that is even and straight . 
he will say : " be ye driven into it ( with ignominy ) ! and speak ye not to me ! 
they say , " we believe in allah and in the messenger , and we obey " : but even after that , some of them turn away : they are not ( really ) believers . 
only those are believers , who believe in allah and his messenger : when they are with him on a matter requiring collective action , they do not depart until they have asked for his leave ; those who ask for thy leave are those who believe in allah and his messenger ; so when they ask for thy leave , for some business of theirs , give leave to those of them whom thou wilt , and ask allah for their forgiveness : for allah is oft - forgiving , most merciful . 
nor canst thou lead back the blind from their straying : only those wilt thou make to hear , who believe in our signs and submit ( their wills in islam ) . 
o prophet ! truly we have sent thee as a witness , a bearer of glad tidings , and warner , - 
then the rest we overwhelmed in the flood . 
" thou hast already fulfilled the vision ! " - thus indeed do we reward those who do right . 
behold , there were brought before him , at eventide coursers of the highest breeding , and swift of foot ; 
behold , thy lord said to the angels : " i am about to create man from clay : 
if it be his will he can still the wind : then would they become motionless on the back of the ( ocean ) . verily in this are signs for everyone who patiently perseveres and is grateful . 
and neither heaven nor earth shed a tear over them : nor were they given a respite ( again ) . 
we created not the heavens , the earth , and all between them , merely in ( idle ) sport : 
so wait thou and watch ; for they ( too ) are waiting . 
" nay , ye thought that the messenger and the believers would never return to their families ; this seemed pleasing in your hearts , and ye conceived an evil thought , for ye are a people lost ( in wickedness ) . " 
as to the righteous , they will be in the midst of gardens and springs , 
and for part of the night also praise thou him , - and at the retreat of the stars ! 
and those who believe in allah and his messengers - they are the sincere ( lovers of truth ) , and the witnesses ( who testify ) , in the eyes of their lord : they shall have their reward and their light . but those who reject allah and deny our signs , - they are the companions of hell - fire . 
that is because they resisted allah and his messenger : and if any one resists allah , verily allah is severe in punishment . 
but those who before them , had homes ( in medina ) and had adopted the faith , - show their affection to such as came to them for refuge , and entertain no desire in their hearts for things given to the ( latter ) , but give them preference over themselves , even though poverty was their ( own lot ) . and those saved from the covetousness of their own souls , - they are the ones that achieve prosperity . 
it may be , if he divorced you ( all ) , that allah will give him in exchange consorts better than you , - who submit ( their wills ) , who believe , who are devout , who turn to allah in repentance , who worship ( in humility ) , who travel ( for faith ) and fast , - previously married or virgins . 
again turn thy vision a second time : ( thy ) vision will come back to thee dull and discomfited , in a state worn out . 
looking towards their lord ; 
the living and the dead , 
and the earth throws up her burdens ( from within ) , 
and there is none like unto him .
