keyboard shortcuts using shortcuts you can configure certain actions to be triggered when you press a key or a combination of keys , e . g . ctrl + c is normally bound to ' copy ' . kde allows you to store more than one ' scheme ' of shortcuts , so you might want to experiment a little setting up your own scheme , although you can still change back to the kde defaults . in the ' global shortcuts ' tab you can configure non - application - specific bindings , like how to switch desktops or maximize a window ; in the ' application shortcuts ' tab you will find bindings typically used in applications , such as copy and paste .

message disposition notification policy mdns are a generalization of what is commonly called read receipt . the message author requests a disposition notification to be sent and the receiver ' s mail program generates a reply from which the author can learn what happened to his message . common disposition types include displayed ( i . e . read ) , deleted and dispatched ( e . g . forwarded ) . the following options are available to control kmail ' s sending of mdns : ignore : ignores any request for disposition notifications . no mdn will ever be sent automatically ( recommended ) . ask : answers requests only after asking the user for permission . this way , you can send mdns for selected messages while denying or ignoring them for others . deny : always sends a denied notification . this is only slightly better than always sending mdns . the author will still know that the messages has been acted upon , he just cannot tell whether it was deleted or read etc . always send : always sends the requested disposition notification . that means that the author of the message gets to know when the message was acted upon and , in addition , what happened to it ( displayed , deleted , etc . ) . this option is strongly discouraged , but since it makes much sense e . g . for customer relationship management , it has been made available .

the parts overview a trace consists of multiple trace parts when there are several profile data files from one profile run . the trace part overview dockable shows these , horizontally ordered in execution time ; the rectangle sizes are proportional to the total cost spent in the parts . you can select one or several parts to constrain all costs shown to these parts only . the parts are further subdivided : there is a partitioning and an callee split mode : partitioning : you see the partitioning into groups for a trace part , according to the group type selected . e . g . if elf object groups are selected , you see colored rectangles for each used elf object ( shared library or executable ) , sized according to the cost spent therein . callee : a rectangle showing the inclusive cost of the current selected function in the trace part is shown . this is split up into smaller rectangles to show the costs of its callees .
